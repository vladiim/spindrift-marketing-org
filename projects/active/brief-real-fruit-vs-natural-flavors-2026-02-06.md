# Content Brief: Real Fruit vs Natural Flavors
**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Author:** Claude

## Topic Angle
Expose what "natural flavors" actually means on a sparkling water label — and why Spindrift's real squeezed fruit is a fundamentally different product, not just a marketing claim. This isn't a competitor attack. It's an ingredient education play that positions Spindrift as the obvious choice for anyone who reads the label.

## Target Audience Segment
**Primary: "The Label Reader"** (27-42, health-conscious, ingredient-skeptical)

This topic hits their core purchase trigger: the ingredient comparison moment in the aisle. They already distrust "natural flavors" as a phrase but may not know what it actually means (FDA allows solvents, preservatives, and synthetic processes under this label). Giving them the facts arms them to articulate why they choose Spindrift — turning customers into advocates.

**Secondary: Parents (30-45)** who apply ingredient scrutiny to family purchases. "Would you squeeze this into your kid's water?" is a powerful reframe.

## Key Messages
1. "Natural flavors" is a legal term, not a quality claim. The FDA definition allows dozens of chemical processes and additives under that umbrella. It tells you nothing about what's actually in the can.
2. Spindrift uses real squeezed fruit — the same ingredient you'd use at home. The slight cloudiness, the real calories, the batch-to-batch flavor variation are all proof it's real.
3. You don't need us to tell you the difference. Flip two cans over. One says "natural flavors." One lists the actual fruit. The ingredient list is the argument.

## Differentiation from Past Content
No prior overlap found. This is the first content brief in the system.

## Distribution Channels
- **Instagram (carousel):** Side-by-side ingredient label comparison. 5 slides: the FDA definition, what "natural flavors" can include, Spindrift's ingredient list, the visible difference (cloudiness = proof), and CTA to check your own fridge.
- **TikTok (15-30s):** "Flip the can" challenge format. Show the back of 4-5 popular sparkling waters, ending with Spindrift. Let the labels speak.
- **Email (educational):** "What does 'natural flavors' actually mean?" — longer-form ingredient education for existing customers. Shareable, arm-your-advocates content.
- **In-store sampling:** Pair the digital campaign with blind taste tests at Whole Foods / Target. The taste difference is the closer.

## Success Metrics
- Instagram carousel: save rate > 5% (educational content benchmarks higher for saves)
- TikTok: completion rate > 60% on "flip the can" video
- Email: forward/share rate as leading indicator of advocacy conversion
- Earned media: pickup by food/ingredient transparency outlets (e.g., Bon Appetit, NYT Cooking)
- In-store: sampling-to-purchase conversion rate at partnered locations

## Draft Outline
1. **Hook:** "Every sparkling water on this shelf says 'natural.' Only one can prove it." (in-aisle visual or video open)
2. **The problem:** What "natural flavors" actually means under FDA rules — solvents, extracts, proprietary blends all qualify. It's a compliance term, not a quality term.
3. **The proof:** Spindrift's ingredient list vs. three competitors, side by side. No commentary needed. The labels are the argument.
4. **The visible test:** Cloudiness, color, pulp — you can see real fruit. You can't see "natural flavors" because there's nothing to see.
5. **The reframe:** "Our 10 calories come from fruit. Their 0 calories come from not having any." Calories as badge, not liability.
6. **CTA:** "Flip the can in your fridge right now. What does it actually say?" Drive UGC and conversation.
