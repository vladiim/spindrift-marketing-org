# Workflow 1: "Real Is Rare" Authenticity Campaign

## Strategic Context

**Diagnosis:** Liquid Death owns "interesting water" through edgy entertainment branding. Spindrift can't win that game and shouldn't try. The crux: attention in the beverage aisle goes to brands with a clear, distinctive story. Spindrift's story (real squeezed fruit, nothing artificial) is genuinely differentiated but undersold.

**Guiding Policy:** Own "authenticity" as the counter-position to performative edge. Make "real ingredients" the most interesting thing about sparkling water. Turn transparency into entertainment.

**Coherent Actions:**

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Audit Current Messaging
- [ ] Collect all current Spindrift copy across channels (packaging, social, web, ads)
- [ ] Map each message to positioning framework: what claim is being made?
- [ ] Identify gaps: where does "real fruit" not come through clearly?
- [ ] Run `/critique` on top 10 pieces of current content

### 1.2 Sharpen the Positioning Wedge
- [ ] Run `/competitor liquid-death` — map their positioning precisely
- [ ] Run `/competitor lacroix` — understand the space we're replacing
- [ ] Run `/diagnose "How do we own authenticity without being boring?"`
- [ ] Draft updated positioning hierarchy in `/memory/shared/positioning.md`

### 1.3 Develop Campaign Concept
- [ ] Brief: "What does 'real' look like when everyone else is performing?"
- [ ] Concept: show the fruit, show the process, show what's NOT in the can
- [ ] Contrast frame: "Other brands add flavor. We squeeze fruit."
- [ ] Develop 3 creative directions for review

---

## Phase 2: Content Engine (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 Hero Content Pieces
- [ ] Run `/brief "Behind the squeeze — how Spindrift is made"`
- [ ] Run `/brief "Ingredient comparison — Spindrift vs the field"`
- [ ] Run `/brief "Why real fruit matters — the science of flavor"`

### 2.2 Social Proof Loop
- [ ] Identify and catalog UGC showing real fruit connection
- [ ] Design "ingredient check" content series (fans reading labels)
- [ ] Create template for rapid response to competitor ingredient scrutiny

### 2.3 Distribution Plan
- [ ] Map content to channels: Instagram (visual), TikTok (process), Twitter (wit)
- [ ] Define posting cadence per channel
- [ ] Set up A/B test framework for messaging variants

## Phase 3: Growth Loop (Week 5-6)

### 3.1 The Transparency Loop
```
Input: Curious health-conscious consumer sees ingredient content
→ Action: Compares Spindrift label to competitor labels
→ Output: Shares the comparison / tells a friend
→ Feeds back: New curious consumer discovers the comparison
```

### 3.2 Activation Tactics
- [ ] "Read the label" challenge campaign
- [ ] Side-by-side ingredient comparison tool on website
- [ ] Sampling program at health-conscious retail (Whole Foods, Sprouts)
- [ ] Partnership with ingredient-transparency advocates/influencers

## Measurement Plan
- **Awareness:** Brand mention volume, share of voice vs Liquid Death
- **Engagement:** Content engagement rate, UGC volume
- **Conversion:** Website traffic from campaign, trial purchase rate
- **Advocacy:** Label comparison shares, NPS movement
- Run `/analytics weekly` throughout campaign
