# Workflow 3: Content Engine — From Brief to Distribution

## Strategic Context

**Diagnosis:** Spindrift has a strong product story (real squeezed fruit) but content production is ad hoc. No systematic pipeline from insight → brief → creation → distribution → measurement → learning. Each piece of content is a one-off instead of part of a compounding system.

**Guiding Policy:** Build a content engine that turns every insight into multiple assets across channels, measures what works, and feeds learnings back into the next cycle. Content should compound — every piece makes the next one better.

## The Content Loop

```
Market Insight / Customer Signal
→ Strategic Brief (/brief)
→ Hero Content (long-form)
→ Repurposed Assets (/repurpose)
→ Distribution (channel-optimized)
→ Measurement (/analytics)
→ Learning (feeds next brief)
```

## Phase 1: Pipeline Setup (Week 1)

### Content Pillars
Based on Spindrift's positioning, establish 4 content pillars:

1. **Real Ingredients** — What's in the can, where it comes from, how it's made
2. **Taste Without Compromise** — Flavor stories, pairing guides, seasonal moments
3. **Transparency Culture** — Behind-the-scenes, supply chain, company values
4. **Community** — Customer stories, UGC, shared moments

### Editorial Calendar Framework
- [ ] Create `/memory/content/editorial-calendar.md`
- [ ] Map pillars to weekly cadence (1 pillar per week, rotating)
- [ ] Define content types per channel:
  - **Instagram:** Visual-first, ingredient beauty shots, short reels
  - **TikTok:** Process videos, taste tests, "what's actually in your drink"
  - **Twitter/X:** Witty observations, ingredient facts, real-time engagement
  - **Email:** Weekly digest, seasonal features, exclusive content
  - **Blog:** Long-form pillar content, SEO plays

## Phase 2: Production Pipeline (Week 2)

### Weekly Content Cycle

**Monday: Brief**
- Run `/brief [topic from calendar]`
- Review brief against positioning and voice
- Assign to production

**Tuesday-Wednesday: Create**
- Produce hero content piece
- Run `/critique` on draft
- Revise based on critique

**Thursday: Repurpose**
- Run `/repurpose [hero-content] thread`
- Run `/repurpose [hero-content] social`
- Run `/repurpose [hero-content] email`
- Quality check all derivatives

**Friday: Distribute**
- Schedule across channels
- Set up tracking parameters
- Document in content log

### Quality Gates (Every Piece)
- [ ] Voice check against `/memory/shared/voice.md`
- [ ] Positioning alignment against `/memory/shared/positioning.md`
- [ ] ICP relevance against `/memory/shared/icp.md`
- [ ] No unsubstantiated claims
- [ ] Clear CTA or engagement hook
- [ ] Channel-appropriate format and length

---

## Phase 3: Measurement Loop (Ongoing)

### Weekly
- Run `/analytics weekly` on content performance
- Identify top-performing content and format
- Note: what topic + format + channel combinations work?

### Monthly
- Content performance deep-dive
- Update content pillars based on performance data
- Adjust editorial calendar weighting
- Archive learnings in `/memory/content/learnings.md`

---

## Content Bank
Maintain a running content bank in `/memory/content/content-bank.md`:
- Ideas captured but not yet briefed
- Seasonal opportunities mapped to calendar
- Evergreen topics for low-effort weeks
- Reactive content templates (trending moments, competitor moves)
