# Workflow 2: Competitive Intelligence System

## Strategic Context

**Diagnosis:** The sparkling water market is shifting fast. Liquid Death raised $67M+ and is expanding beyond water. LaCroix is declining. Topo Chico lost indie credibility post-Coca-Cola acquisition. Store brands are commoditizing the low end. Spindrift needs a systematic way to track these shifts and respond with speed.

**Guiding Policy:** Build a recurring competitive intelligence loop that turns market signals into positioning advantages. React to competitor moves within days, not quarters.

## Setup (One-time)

### Intelligence Framework
- [ ] Run `/competitor liquid-death` — full Dunford's analysis
- [ ] Run `/competitor lacroix` — full Dunford's analysis
- [ ] Run `/competitor topo-chico` — full Dunford's analysis
- [ ] Save all to `/memory/strategy/competitors/`
- [ ] Create competitive comparison matrix in `/memory/strategy/competitive-matrix.md`

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Define key signals to track per competitor:
  - New product launches
  - Pricing changes
  - Distribution changes
  - Campaign launches
  - Social media positioning shifts
  - Partnership announcements
  - Earned media coverage
- [ ] Set up monitoring cadence: weekly scan, monthly deep-dive

## Recurring Cadence

### Weekly (5 minutes — part of `/weekly-review`)
- Scan competitor social channels for new campaigns or messaging shifts
- Check trade press for competitive news
- Note any changes in `/memory/strategy/competitors/weekly-signals.md`

### Monthly (built into monthly planning)
- Re-run `/competitor` for any competitor with significant changes
- Update competitive matrix
- Run `/diagnose` if a competitor move requires strategic response
- Brief creative division on any messaging implications

### Quarterly (strategy division owns)
- Full positioning review against all competitors
- Update `/memory/shared/positioning.md` if needed
- Identify emerging competitors not yet tracked
- Present findings to leadership

## Response Playbooks

### Competitor Launches New Product
1. Assess overlap with Spindrift's positioning
2. Run `/diagnose "competitor X launched Y — implications for Spindrift"`
3. If positioning threat: escalate to strategy for response plan
4. If no threat: document and monitor

### Competitor Changes Pricing
1. Map pricing change against Spindrift's price points
2. Assess impact on perceived value positioning
3. If significant: brief strategy + growth divisions
4. If minor: document and monitor

### Competitor Gains Distribution
1. Identify specific retail overlaps
2. Assess shelf-space implications
3. If in Spindrift's key accounts: escalate to leadership
4. If peripheral: document and monitor

### Competitor Viral Moment
1. Assess relevance to Spindrift's positioning
2. Do NOT react publicly unless directly mentioned
3. If opportunity to contrast authentically: brief creative
4. If not relevant: ignore (attention is finite)

## Output
All intelligence stored in `/memory/strategy/competitors/`
Key findings surfaced in `/weekly-review`
Strategic implications flow to positioning updates
