### What's Inside

| Folder / File | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | The brain — company context, divisions, approval matrix, handoff protocols |
| `playbooks/` | One playbook per division with SOPs, workflows, and quality standards |
| `memory/shared/` | ICP, positioning, and voice guide used by every division |
| `memory/[division]/` | Division-specific knowledge that compounds over time |
| `projects/` | Active work and backlog tracking |
| `.claude/skills/` | 8 slash commands + customised marketing skills |
| `prompts/` | Prompt systematization — how the command library grows from usage |
| `tools/` | Tool discovery and skills index for continuous improvement |

## How to Build Your Own

1. Copy the [mega prompt](https://gist.github.com/vladiim/137404dd999af392bcb29fa1054f959a)
2. Fill in the "My Context" section with your company details
3. Open [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup)
4. Paste the prompt and let it run (~30 minutes)

You'll get a complete marketing org customised for your brand.

### The Prompt

The mega prompt has three parts:

- **The Marketing Mind** — a philosophy section that teaches Claude how to think about marketing (frameworks from Rumelt, Dunford, Balfour)
- **Your Context** — company, ICP, challenge, competitors
- **The Task** — nine steps that build the full system

## Nine Components

1. `CLAUDE.md` — operating system for the org
2. Division playbooks — SOPs for each team
3. Memory — persistent, compounding knowledge
4. Project structure — WIP tracking
5. Starter workflows — immediate actions based on your challenge
6. Slash commands — one-keystroke operations (`/wip`, `/brief`, `/competitor`, `/weekly-review`, etc.)
7. Marketing skills — pulled from [marketingskills](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills), customised for your brand
8. Prompt systematization — commands grow from actual usage
9. Tool discovery — the system improves itself weekly
