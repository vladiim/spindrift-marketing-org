# /launch-strategy — CPG Launch Strategy Builder

Builds a comprehensive launch plan for Spindrift product launches, retail expansions, and seasonal activations. Uses the ORB framework (Owned, Rented, Borrowed) adapted for CPG and Spindrift's three-phase launch model.

## Before Executing

Read the following memory files to ground the launch in Spindrift's actual situation:

- `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` — company, product, and competitive context
- `/memory/shared/positioning.md` — positioning framework and messaging hierarchy
- `/memory/shared/icp.md` — ideal customer profile, purchase triggers, and discovery channels
- `/memory/shared/voice.md` — brand voice guidelines across all channels

Also scan for additional context:

- `/memory/strategy/` — prior launches and strategic context
- `/projects/active/` — current initiatives to coordinate with
- `/memory/analytics/` — performance data from previous launches

## Spindrift Launch Types

### New Flavor Launch (Primary)
- **Frequency:** 2-4 per year
- **Lead time:** 8-12 weeks pre-launch marketing activation
- **Key moment:** The ingredient reveal. What real fruit is in this one? That IS the story.
- **Success metrics:** Trial velocity (units in first 30 days), repeat rate at 60 days, DTC conversion rate, social engagement on reveal content.

### Seasonal Launch
- **Frequency:** 2-3 per year (summer hero, fall/winter, spring refresh)
- **Lead time:** 6-8 weeks
- **Key moment:** Seasonal fruit connection. "This fruit is in season. So is this Spindrift."
- **Success metrics:** Seasonal sell-through rate, lift vs. base period, social buzz during window.

### Retail Expansion
- **Frequency:** Ongoing, milestone-based (new retailer, new region, new shelf placement)
- **Lead time:** 4-6 weeks post-confirmation
- **Key moment:** "Now available at [retailer]." Make the where-to-buy the hero.
- **Success metrics:** First 90-day velocity at new retailer, regional awareness lift, store-level trial.

### Limited Edition
- **Frequency:** 1-2 per year
- **Lead time:** 4-6 weeks
- **Key moment:** Scarcity + ingredient story. "We found this fruit. We made 10,000 cases. That's it."
- **Success metrics:** Sell-through rate, waitlist sign-ups, social sharing, email engagement.

## Spindrift Three-Phase Launch Model

### Phase 1: TEASER (2-3 weeks pre-launch)
**Theme:** The ingredient reveal. Build anticipation around the real fruit, not the product.

- **Owned:** Email teaser series (ingredient clues, behind-the-scenes sourcing), social hints (close-up fruit imagery, "something's coming" without being coy), website countdown or landing page.
- **Rented:** Dark social ads targeting existing customers and high-value lookalikes. Spark anticipation, don't sell yet.
- **Borrowed:** Seed product to 15-25 micro-influencers (nutritionists, food creators, ingredient-focused accounts). NDA until launch day. PR embargo pitch to food/beverage editors.

**Spindrift creative rules for teaser:**
- Show the fruit before the can. The ingredient IS the tease.
- Never use generic "something big is coming" language. Be specific about the fruit story.
- Email subject lines should provoke ingredient curiosity: "We squeezed something new."

### Phase 2: LAUNCH (Launch week + 2 weeks)
**Theme:** Available now. Here's what's in it. Here's where to get it.

- **Owned:** Full announcement email (ingredient list as hero), social blitz (all platforms, product + fruit imagery), website feature (new flavor page with ingredient transparency, where-to-buy, DTC purchase), SMS if applicable.
- **Rented:** Paid social activation across Meta, TikTok, Google. Retail media at launch retailers. Full-funnel: awareness (ingredient story) + conversion (shop now / find in store). Target: heavy first-week spend to establish velocity.
- **Borrowed:** Influencer posts go live (coordinated timing). PR embargo lifts. Sampling events at key retail locations. Partnership activations if applicable (e.g., co-branded with a complementary brand).

**Spindrift creative rules for launch:**
- Lead with the ingredient list. "Sparkling water + real squeezed [fruit]. That's it."
- Where-to-buy must be prominent. CPG launch fails when people can't find the product.
- Include a "first taste" UGC prompt — encourage customers to share their reaction.

### Phase 3: SUSTAIN (Weeks 3-8 post-launch)
**Theme:** Social proof, reviews, replenishment, and integration into the lineup.

- **Owned:** Review/UGC roundup emails, "still loving it?" replenishment reminders, flavor comparison content (how it compares to other Spindrift flavors), recipe integration (cocktails, mocktails, cooking).
- **Rented:** Retargeting to launch-week engagers who didn't convert. Lookalike expansion from launch purchasers. Shift budget from awareness to conversion/retention.
- **Borrowed:** Second-wave influencer content (recipes, pairings, "still drinking it" authenticity). Retail sampling programs. Partnership content if applicable.

**Spindrift creative rules for sustain:**
- Let customer voices lead. UGC and reviews are more credible than brand claims in this phase.
- Replenishment emails should be helpful, not pushy. "Running low? Here's a shortcut."
- Transition from "try it" to "it's part of the rotation."

## ORB Framework — Spindrift CPG Adaptation

### Owned Channels
| Channel | Role in Launch | Spindrift Notes |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Email list | Primary DTC conversion + loyalty | Segment: existing buyers, flavor-curious, lapsed. Subject lines: ingredient-forward. |
| Social (organic) | Brand storytelling + community | Instagram: polished but real. TikTok: native, process-focused. |
| Website/DTC | Conversion + ingredient education | New flavor pages must include: ingredient list, sourcing info, taste description, reviews. |
| SMS | Time-sensitive alerts | Use sparingly. Launch day + restock only. |
| Packaging | In-hand storytelling | QR code to flavor story, cross-sell other flavors on-pack. |

### Rented Channels
| Channel | Role in Launch | Spindrift Notes |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Meta ads | Full-funnel DTC + awareness | Lead with fruit visuals. See `/paid-ads` skill for specs. |
| TikTok ads | Awareness + discovery | Spark Ads from organic/influencer content. Process videos. |
| Google ads | Intent capture | Category + brand terms. Shopping ads for DTC. |
| Retail media | In-store conversion | Instacart, retailer networks. Promote at launch retailers. |
| Podcast ads | Trust-building awareness | Host-read preferred. Ingredient story as the talking point. |

### Borrowed Channels
| Channel | Role in Launch | Spindrift Notes |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Micro-influencers | Credibility + reach | 15-25 per launch. Nutritionists, food creators, ingredient-focused. Authenticity > reach. |
| PR / earned media | Authority + awareness | Food/beverage editors, health/wellness press. Ingredient angle, not lifestyle. |
| Partnerships | Audience expansion | Complementary brands (premium snacks, meal kits, fitness studios). Co-sampling, co-content. |
| Sampling | Trial generation | In-store demos, event sampling, subscription box inserts. The product sells itself on first sip. |
| Retail partnerships | Shelf presence | End-cap placements, seasonal displays, retailer social co-posts. |

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Define Launch Parameters

- **Launch type:** New flavor / Seasonal / Retail expansion / Limited edition
- **Product:** Specific SKU or product line
- **Launch date:** Target date
- **Key retailers:** Where it will be available
- **Budget tier:** Full launch / Moderate / Lean

### Step 2: Build the Three-Phase Timeline

Map the teaser, launch, and sustain phases to specific calendar dates. Assign channel activations to each phase using the ORB framework.

### Step 3: Develop Creative Strategy per Phase

For each phase, specify:
- Key message (aligned to messaging hierarchy from positioning.md)
- Creative formats per channel
- Ingredient story angle
- Voice/tone calibration (teaser = curiosity, launch = confidence, sustain = warmth)

### Step 4: Set Measurement Framework

- **Pre-launch:** Email open rates, social engagement on teasers, waitlist sign-ups
- **Launch week:** Units sold (DTC + retail), website traffic, social impressions, influencer reach, email conversion
- **Sustain:** Repeat purchase rate, review volume, subscription conversion, retail velocity trend
