# /competitor-alternatives — Competitor Alternatives Page Builder

Builds a "Spindrift vs [Competitor]" or "[Competitor] Alternative" landing page using April Dunford's positioning framework. Designed for SEO capture of comparison-intent searches. Honest, never disparaging — leads with what makes Spindrift different, not what makes competitors bad.

## Before Executing

Read the following memory files:

- `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` — company, product, competitive landscape
- `/memory/shared/positioning.md` — positioning framework, competitive comparison matrix, competitive reframes
- `/memory/shared/voice.md` — brand voice guidelines
- `/memory/shared/icp.md` — ideal customer profile

Then check `/memory/strategy/competitors/` for any existing competitive analysis on the specified competitor (generated by `/competitor`).

## Spindrift's Competitive Set

| Competitor | Search Intent | Spindrift's Angle | Page Tone |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Liquid Death** | "liquid death alternative," "sparkling water without the edge" | Substance over stunts. Real fruit inside, not just a cool can outside. Their flavored line uses "natural flavors." | Confident, wry. Respect their marketing, differentiate on product. |
| **LaCroix** | "lacroix alternative," "better than lacroix," "lacroix natural flavors" | Next generation. Real squeezed fruit vs "natural flavors." Spindrift is what LaCroix would be if they used real ingredients. | Warm, factual. Don't punch down — LaCroix introduced millions to sparkling water. Acknowledge that, then differentiate. |
| **Topo Chico** | "topo chico alternative," "topo chico flavored water" | Independent vs corporate (Coca-Cola acquired Topo Chico). Real fruit vs "natural flavors" in their flavored line. | Respectful. Acknowledge Topo Chico's mineral water heritage, differentiate on flavored products and independence. |
| **Store Brands** | "best sparkling water," "sparkling water worth the price" | Worth the premium. Check the ingredients — store brands use "natural flavors." You're paying for real fruit, not just fizzy water. | Direct, unpretentious. Don't be snobby about price sensitivity. Show the value clearly. |

## Positioning Framework (Dunford Method)

For each alternatives page, structure the argument using April Dunford's framework:

1. **Competitive Alternatives** — Acknowledge what the searcher is currently using or considering. Respect it.
2. **Unique Capabilities** — What Spindrift does that the competitor literally cannot (real squeezed fruit, transparent ingredient list, visible proof in the can).
3. **Value** — What those capabilities mean for the customer (trust, taste, ingredient confidence).
4. **Best-Fit Customer** — Who benefits most from switching (Label Readers, parents, ingredient-conscious buyers).
5. **Market Category** — Frame Spindrift not as "another sparkling water" but as "the only sparkling water made with real squeezed fruit."

## Content Principles for Alternatives Pages

1. **Honest comparison, never disparagement.** State facts about competitors that are publicly verifiable (ingredient lists, ownership, pricing). Never mock, belittle, or misrepresent.
2. **Lead with ingredient transparency.** The comparison table should center on what's actually in each product. This is where Spindrift wins every time.
3. **Acknowledge competitor strengths.** LaCroix made sparkling water mainstream. Liquid Death has brilliant marketing. Topo Chico has mineral water heritage. Saying this builds credibility.
4. **Let the ingredient list be the closer.** The most powerful element on the page is a side-by-side ingredient comparison. Spindrift's list reads like a recipe. Theirs doesn't.
5. **Never name competitors in ad copy promoting these pages.** The page itself can name them (it's editorial/comparison content), but any paid promotion driving traffic to these pages should use category terms, not competitor names.

## Execution Steps

1. **Read all memory files** and any existing competitor analysis.
2. **Identify the competitor** from the argument. If not in the competitive set, adapt the framework but flag that this is outside the primary set.
3. **Research the competitor's current positioning:**
   - What is their ingredient list for comparable products?
   - How do they price comparable products?
   - What is their brand positioning and messaging?
   - What are their genuine strengths?
4. **Build the page using the Dunford framework**, structured for both SEO and conversion.
5. **Run quality gates** (see below).
6. **Save** to `/projects/active/pages/alternative-[competitor-slug]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`.

## Quality Gates

- [ ] **Honesty check:** Every competitor claim is factually accurate and publicly verifiable. Could a journalist fact-check this page and find no errors?
- [ ] **Tone check:** Would the competitor read this page and think "that's fair"? Firm differentiation without cheap shots.
- [ ] **Voice check:** Does the page sound like Spindrift (real, warm, confident) and not like a generic SaaS comparison page?
- [ ] **Ingredient transparency:** Is the ingredient comparison front-and-center, not buried?
- [ ] **Positioning alignment:** Does the page reinforce Spindrift's category of one ("only sparkling water made with real squeezed fruit")?
- [ ] **ICP alignment:** Does the page speak to the Label Reader's motivations (ingredient truth, taste, trust)?
- [ ] **SEO coverage:** Does the page target relevant search terms? (e.g., "[competitor] alternative," "spindrift vs [competitor]," "[competitor] ingredients")
- [ ] **CTA clarity:** Is there a clear, non-aggressive next step? ("Try Spindrift," "Find near you," "See our ingredients")
