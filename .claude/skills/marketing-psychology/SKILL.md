# /marketing-psychology — Marketing Psychology Analysis & Application

Applies behavioral psychology and persuasion models to Spindrift's marketing challenges. Pre-loaded with Spindrift-relevant psychological frameworks. Includes ethical guardrails — Spindrift persuades through truth and transparency, never through fear or manipulation.

## Before Executing

Read the following memory files:

- `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` — company, product, competitive landscape
- `/memory/shared/voice.md` — brand voice guidelines
- `/memory/shared/positioning.md` — positioning and messaging hierarchy
- `/memory/shared/icp.md` — ideal customer profile (psychographics, purchase triggers, objections, JTBD)

## Spindrift-Relevant Psychology Models

These models are pre-loaded because they directly apply to Spindrift's positioning, audience, and competitive context. Use them as lenses, not formulas.

### 1. Ingredient Transparency as Trust Signal
**Model:** Transparency builds trust faster than claims. When consumers can verify a claim themselves (by reading the ingredient list), the brand earns credibility that advertising alone cannot buy.

**Spindrift application:**
- The ingredient list IS the marketing. Every touchpoint should invite verification: "Flip the can. Read the ingredients."
- Transparency reduces purchase risk. The consumer doesn't have to trust a tagline — they can trust their own eyes.
- Short ingredient lists signal honesty. Length correlates with suspicion in the health-conscious consumer's mind.
- Spindrift's slight cloudiness and color variation serve as visual proof — the product itself is a trust signal.

**Tactical use:** Calls-to-action that invite ingredient inspection. Comparison content that shows ingredient lists side by side. Packaging design that features the ingredient list prominently.

### 2. Social Proof Through UGC
**Model:** People trust peer experiences more than brand claims (Cialdini's social proof). For CPG, user-generated content is the most credible form of social proof because it's unsolicited and unpaid.

**Spindrift application:**
- The ICP trusts micro-influencers (30K followers) over celebrities (3M followers). Authenticity of recommendation > reach.
- "Fridge shelfie" content — photos of Spindrift in real people's fridges — is powerful because it signals habitual use, not one-time sponsorship.
- The taste-surprise moment (expecting another seltzer, tasting real fruit) is inherently shareable. First reactions are a content gold mine.
- Fan-created content (recipes, stocking videos, reviews) should be amplified more than brand-created content.

**Tactical use:** UGC campaigns, review amplification, community features, first-try reaction content, "show your fridge" prompts.

### 3. Authenticity as Differentiator
**Model:** In categories where most brands use similar marketing tactics, genuine authenticity becomes a competitive advantage. Authenticity is not a tone — it's the alignment between what a brand says and what the product actually is.

**Spindrift application:**
- Spindrift's authenticity is structural, not performative. The product literally contains real fruit. The voice isn't "authentic-sounding" — it's authentic because the claims are true.
- Liquid Death performs authenticity through irony and edge. Spindrift performs authenticity through ingredient truth. Both work, but Spindrift's ages better because it's product-grounded, not brand-grounded.
- The "natural flavors" industry norm creates an authenticity gap in the category that Spindrift fills by default.
- Never manufacture authenticity (behind-the-scenes content that's actually staged, "real talk" that's actually scripted). The audience has a finely tuned BS detector.

**Tactical use:** Ingredient-first messaging, unpolished product content, honest acknowledgment of trade-offs (yes, there are calories — from fruit), showing the messy reality of real-fruit production.

### 4. Loss Aversion Around "Natural Flavors" Deception
**Model:** People are more motivated by avoiding a loss than gaining a benefit (Kahneman & Tversky). Reframing a purchase as avoiding a negative outcome can be more compelling than promising a positive one.

**Spindrift application:**
- Consumers who learn what "natural flavors" actually means (a catch-all term with minimal regulation) feel deceived by brands they trusted. This feeling of deception is a loss — lost trust, lost confidence in their choices.
- Spindrift can position itself as the remedy for that loss: "Now you know. And now you have an option."
- This model is powerful but must be handled carefully (see Ethical Guardrails). The goal is education, not fear. Inform people about "natural flavors," don't terrify them.
- The reframe: you're not paying more for Spindrift. You're choosing not to pay for "natural flavors" anymore.

**Tactical use:** Educational content about "natural flavors" (what the term means, how it's regulated), ingredient comparison content, "what's actually in your sparkling water" angles. Always educational, never alarmist.

### 5. Anchoring on Real Ingredients
**Model:** The first piece of information people receive becomes the anchor against which they evaluate everything else (Tversky & Kahneman). If the first thing a consumer learns about Spindrift is the ingredient list, everything else is evaluated through that lens.

**Spindrift application:**
- Lead every touchpoint with the ingredient truth. If the first thing someone learns is "made with real squeezed fruit," they anchor on that. Price, calories, availability — all secondary.
- At shelf, the ingredient list flip is the conversion moment. Everything in-store should drive toward that action.
- In digital, the ingredient comparison should come before the taste claim, the lifestyle imagery, or the pricing. Anchor first.
- The calorie conversation is won by anchoring: "10 calories from real grapefruit juice" anchors on "real grapefruit juice," not "10 calories."

**Tactical use:** Ingredient-first messaging hierarchy, "flip the can" CTAs, leading with the ingredient list in ads and landing pages, reframing calories as proof of real fruit.

### 6. Endowment Effect & Taste Experience
**Model:** Once people experience something, they value it more than before the experience (endowment effect). First taste is disproportionately important for CPG trial-to-repeat conversion.

**Spindrift application:**
- The taste-surprise moment — real fruit flavor vs expected "seltzer" flavor — creates an instant endowment. They now have a reference point for what sparkling water can taste like.
- Sampling is Spindrift's highest-ROI marketing activity. Every trial converts at higher rates than any ad because the product itself is the best argument.
- Post-trial messaging should reference the taste experience: "You've tasted the difference." This activates the endowment effect.
- The ICP's purchase trigger #4 (taste surprise) is this model in action.

**Tactical use:** Sampling programs, trial offers, post-purchase emails that reference the taste experience, "your first Spindrift" moments, side-by-side taste comparisons.

### 7. Identity Signaling & Subtle Status
**Model:** Purchases signal identity to self and others. The signal doesn't need to be loud — subtle signals can be more powerful because they're interpreted as genuine rather than performative (Berger, "Invisible Influence").

**Spindrift application:**
- The ICP's status signaling is subtle: "Having Spindrift in the fridge signals taste and intentionality, not rebellion. It's the Patagonia of sparkling water."
- Spindrift shouldn't position itself as cool, edgy, or exclusive. It should position itself as the choice of people who pay attention. The signal is competence, not rebellion.
- This contrasts directly with Liquid Death's loud identity signaling (skulls, punk aesthetic). Spindrift's signal is quieter but stickier.
- Hosting occasions are identity-signaling moments: offering Spindrift to guests says "I chose this on purpose."

**Tactical use:** Hosting/entertaining content, "what your fridge says about you" angles, aspirational but accessible lifestyle positioning, content that makes the reader feel smart for choosing well.

## Ethical Guardrails

Spindrift persuades through truth, not manipulation. These guardrails are non-negotiable:

### Never Do
- **Fear-mongering about competitor ingredients.** "Natural flavors" education should inform, not terrify. Never imply competitor products are dangerous, toxic, or harmful. They're legal, safe products. Spindrift's argument is transparency and taste, not safety.
- **Manufactured urgency.** No "limited time" unless genuinely limited. No "running out" unless genuinely low stock. No countdown timers for arbitrary deadlines.
- **Guilt or shame.** Never imply the consumer is making a bad choice by drinking something else. Offer a better option. Don't judge the current one.
- **Health claims.** Spindrift is not a health product. Never imply it prevents disease, aids weight loss, or provides therapeutic benefit. It's sparkling water with real fruit.
- **Exploitation of anxiety.** No "do you know what you're really drinking?" fear angles. The educational version is "here's what 'natural flavors' means." The exploitative version is "you should be scared of what's in your drink."
- **Dark patterns.** No confusing unsubscribe flows, no pre-checked boxes, no hidden terms. Transparency extends to UX.

### Always Do
- **Educate, then invite.** Give people information. Let them decide. The product truth is compelling enough without coercion.
- **Respect the competitor's consumer.** Someone drinking LaCroix isn't wrong. They just don't have all the information yet. Speak to the curious, not the convicted.
- **Ground every psychological lever in product truth.** Every persuasion technique must connect back to something real about Spindrift. If the technique works without the product truth, it's manipulation.
- **Pass the "would we publish our strategy?" test.** If Spindrift's marketing psychology playbook were published in the NYT, would we be proud of it? If not, revise.

## Execution Steps

1. **Read all memory files.**
2. **Identify the marketing challenge** from the user's request — this could be:
   - Analyzing an existing asset through psychology lenses
   - Recommending psychological approaches for a new campaign
   - Strengthening copy with behavioral insights
   - Designing a conversion flow with psychology in mind
   - Understanding why something isn't working
3. **Select the most relevant models** from the seven above (plus any additional models that apply).
4. **Apply each model** to the specific challenge, with concrete recommendations.
5. **Run ethical guardrails** on every recommendation.
6. **Produce the analysis** in the format below.

## Quality Gates

- [ ] **Ethical check:** Does every recommendation pass the ethical guardrails? Would we be comfortable if our marketing psychology strategy were public?
- [ ] **Product grounding:** Is every psychological lever connected to a real product truth? Or could this technique work for any brand?
- [ ] **Voice alignment:** Do the recommended approaches sound like Spindrift (real, warm, confident) or like a manipulative growth-hacking playbook?
- [ ] **ICP respect:** Do these approaches treat the Label Reader as an intelligent, discerning person? Or do they try to trick someone?
- [ ] **Competitor respect:** Do these approaches differentiate from competitors without demonizing them?
