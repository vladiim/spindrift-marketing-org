# /referral-program — Referral Program Design

Designs and optimizes Spindrift's referral program. Built for CPG: physical product sharing, subscription referrals, and sampling-driven referral loops. Positioned around Spindrift's authenticity angle — "Share What's Real."

## Before Executing

Read the following memory files to ground the program in Spindrift's actual situation:

- `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` — company, product, and competitive context
- `/memory/shared/positioning.md` — positioning framework (referral messaging must align)
- `/memory/shared/icp.md` — ideal customer profile, purchase triggers, discovery channels, and social jobs
- `/memory/shared/voice.md` — brand voice guidelines (referral touchpoints must sound like Spindrift)

Also scan for additional context:

- `/memory/analytics/` — customer LTV data, acquisition costs, subscription metrics
- `/projects/active/` — existing referral or loyalty programs
- `/memory/strategy/` — strategic priorities affecting growth channels

## Spindrift Referral Context

### Why Referral Works for Spindrift

From the ICP document, Spindrift's #3 purchase trigger is **social proof (analog):**
> "Seeing it in a friend's fridge, being handed one at a party, noticing it at a meeting. Physical trial in trusted contexts."

Referral formalizes what already happens organically. Spindrift customers already share — the program gives them a reason and a mechanism.

Additionally, the ICP's social jobs include:
- "Have something to offer at gatherings that starts a positive conversation"
- "Model good beverage choices for my kids/partner/friends without lecturing"
- "Signal that I pay attention to quality without being pretentious"

A referral program channels these natural behaviors into trackable, incentivized acquisition.

### Program Concept: "Share What's Real"

**Positioning:** Referral isn't a discount program. It's an extension of Spindrift's authenticity. When you share Spindrift, you're sharing something genuinely good — real ingredients, real taste, real recommendation.

**Tone:** Warm, confident, peer-to-peer. Not salesy. The referral message should feel like a friend saying "You should try this" — because that's literally what it is.

**Tagline options:**
- "Share what's real."
- "Send a friend the real thing."
- "Know someone who reads labels? They'll love this."

### Default Incentive Structure

**Double-sided incentives (both sides get value):**

| Role | Incentive | Value | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Referrer** | Free 8-pack | ~$7 value | Reward with product, not cash. Reinforces product love. Keeps the referrer drinking Spindrift. |
| **Friend (referred)** | 20% off first order | ~$6-8 savings | Lowers the trial barrier without devaluing the product. 20% is meaningful but preserves premium positioning. |

**Alternative incentive tiers to test:**

| Tier | Referrer Gets | Friend Gets | When to Use |
|------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Standard | Free 8-pack | 20% off first order | Default |
| Subscription boost | Free 8-pack + bonus in next delivery | 25% off first subscription order | Prioritize subscription acquisition |
| Sampling | "Send a friend a free sample 4-pack" | Free 4-pack (no purchase required) | Maximize trial, accept higher CAC |
| Milestone | Escalating rewards (1 referral = 8-pack, 3 = variety pack, 5 = month free) | 20% off first order | Reward power referrers |

### CPG-Specific Referral Mechanics

#### "Share a Can" Program
- Physical: Include referral cards in every DTC shipment. Card has a unique code + a QR link. "Hand this to someone who reads labels."
- Digital: Shareable link via email, text, or social. Pre-written message (editable) that sounds like a real recommendation, not a marketing pitch.

#### Subscription Referral Loop
- Subscribers get a unique referral link in their account dashboard and every shipment confirmation email.
- When a referral converts to a subscription, the referrer earns a bonus (extra 8-pack in next delivery or a month free).
- Subscription-to-subscription referrals have the highest LTV — prioritize this loop.

#### Sampling-Driven Referral
- Allow customers to "send a free sample" to a friend (brand pays for the sample, customer provides the address).
- Cap at 2-3 free samples per customer to manage cost.
- This is the highest-conversion referral path because it removes the purchase friction entirely. The product sells itself on first taste.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Define Scope

Based on the provided `[scope]`, focus the work:

- **Full design:** Complete referral program from scratch
- **Incentive structure:** Optimize or redesign the reward structure
- **Messaging:** Develop referral copy across all touchpoints
- **Measurement:** Build the measurement framework for an existing program
- **Iteration:** Analyze current performance and recommend improvements

### Step 2: Design the Program Structure

#### Referral Flow
1. **Trigger:** Customer receives referral prompt (post-purchase email, shipment insert, account dashboard, post-review)
2. **Share:** Customer shares via unique link (email, text, social) or physical card
3. **Arrive:** Friend lands on referral landing page (personalized: "[Name] thinks you'll love Spindrift")
4. **Convert:** Friend makes first purchase with incentive applied
5. **Reward:** Referrer receives reward (automated, with confirmation email)
6. **Loop:** New customer enters the referral funnel themselves

#### Touchpoint Map
| Touchpoint | Timing | Message Focus | Format |
|-----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| Post-purchase email | 3 days after first order | "Love it? Share it." | Email with unique link |
| Shipment insert | Every DTC delivery | "Hand this to someone who reads labels." | Physical card with code |
| Post-review prompt | After leaving a review | "You just said something great. Share it with a friend." | On-site + email |
| Account dashboard | Always visible | Referral status, unique link, share tools | Web page |
| Subscription confirmation | Every renewal email | Evergreen referral CTA | Email footer |
| Milestone email | After 3rd, 5th, 10th order | "You're a regular. Know someone who should be?" | Dedicated email |

### Step 3: Develop Messaging

All referral messaging must pass the Spindrift voice check:
- Is it real? (Does it sound like a genuine recommendation, not a marketing scheme?)
- Is it warm? (Does it feel like sharing something you love, not selling something?)
- Is it confident? (Does it assume the product will speak for itself?)
- Does it avoid the "Words We Avoid" list?

**Example messaging by touchpoint:**

**Post-purchase email:**
> Subject: Know someone who reads labels?
>
> You tried Spindrift. You know what's in it (real squeezed fruit, that's it). Now share it with someone who'd appreciate that.
>
> Give them 20% off their first order. You'll get a free 8-pack when they buy.
>
> [Share with a friend]
>
> P.S. — No one has to read a label to enjoy it. But your kind of person probably will.

**Shipment insert card:**
> Front: "Share what's real."
> Back: "Give this to someone who'd flip the can. They'll get 20% off. You'll get a free 8-pack. [Code] or scan: [QR]"

**Referral landing page:**
> [Friend's name] thinks you should try Spindrift.
>
> It's sparkling water made with real squeezed fruit. Not "natural flavors." Real fruit. You can taste the difference because there is one.
>
> They liked it enough to share it. That's the best review we could ask for.
>
> [Get 20% off your first order]

**Social share (pre-written, editable):**
> "I've been drinking this sparkling water made with actual squeezed fruit (not 'natural flavors') and it's really good. Here's 20% off if you want to try it: [link]"

### Step 4: Build Measurement Framework

#### Primary Metrics
| Metric | Definition | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **Referral rate** | % of customers who refer | 8-12% | Baseline for program health |
| **Referral conversion rate** | % of referred friends who purchase | 15-25% | Quality of referral + incentive effectiveness |
| **Referred customer LTV** | Lifetime value of referred customers | 1.2-1.5x organic LTV | Referred customers should be higher quality |
| **CAC via referral** | Cost to acquire via referral (incentive cost) | <$15 | Should be lower than paid CAC (<$18) |
| **Viral coefficient** | Average referrals per customer that convert | >0.15 | Program's contribution to organic growth |

#### Referred vs. Organic Customer Comparison
Track these metrics segmented by acquisition source:
- **First-order AOV:** Do referred customers spend more or less?
- **Subscription conversion rate:** Do referred customers subscribe at higher rates?
- **30/60/90-day retention:** Do referred customers stick around longer?
- **LTV at 6 and 12 months:** Is the referred cohort more valuable?
- **Referral propensity:** Do referred customers refer others? (Measuring the viral loop)

#### Unit Economics
```
Referral CAC = (Referrer incentive cost + Friend incentive cost + Program overhead) / Referred conversions
Target: Referral CAC < $15 (vs. paid CAC target of <$18)

Referrer incentive cost: ~$4 (COGS of free 8-pack)
Friend incentive cost: ~$6-8 (20% off ~$32 AOV = ~$6.40 margin impact)
Program overhead: Platform fees, card printing, etc.

Break-even: Referred customer must generate >$10-12 in first order margin
```

### Step 5: Plan for Iteration

- **Month 1-2:** Launch with standard incentive. Measure baseline referral rate and conversion.
- **Month 3:** A/B test incentive variants (see `/ab-test-setup`). Test: subscription bonus vs. standard, sampling vs. discount.
- **Month 4-5:** Optimize messaging based on performance by touchpoint. Which prompt drives the most referrals?
- **Month 6:** Introduce milestone rewards for power referrers. Evaluate referred customer LTV vs. organic.
- **Ongoing:** Quarterly review of referral economics. Adjust incentives if CAC drifts. Test seasonal referral campaigns (holiday gifting, summer sharing).
