This file is read by all marketing skills before execution. It provides the essential context needed to produce brand-aligned output.

---

## Company

**Name:** Spindrift
**Category:** Sparkling water / better-for-you beverages
**Tagline:** Sparkling water made with real squeezed fruit
**Founded:** 2010, Newton, MA
**Stage:** Growth — $100M+ revenue, national distribution

## Product

**What it is:** Sparkling water made with real squeezed fruit juice. No artificial sweeteners, no natural flavors (the industry euphemism), no concentrates. Just carbonated water and real fruit.

**Key differentiator:** Only sparkling water brand using real squeezed fruit. Every other brand uses "natural flavors" — a catch-all term that can mean almost anything. Spindrift's ingredient list is transparent: water, fruit juice. That's it.

**Product line:** Multiple fruit flavors (Raspberry Lime, Grapefruit, Lemon, Pineapple, Mango Orange, etc.) plus Half & Half (sparkling lemonade + iced tea), Island Punch, and seasonal varieties.

**Price positioning:** Premium — typically $5-7 per 8-pack vs $3-5 for competitors. Justified by real ingredients.

## Target Customer

**Primary:** Health-conscious millennials and Gen Z (25-40)
**Psychographic:** Reads ingredients. Values authenticity over performance. Willing to pay more for quality. Skeptical of "natural flavors" claims. Prefers brands with substance over brands with attitude.
**Behavioral:** Shops at Whole Foods, Target, Costco. Active on Instagram and TikTok. Influenced by ingredient transparency more than celebrity endorsement.

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Positioning | Our Angle Against Them |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Liquid Death | Edgy entertainment brand | We have substance, not stunts |
| LaCroix | Legacy sparkling water | We're the next generation — real fruit vs "natural flavors" |
| Topo Chico | Mineral water heritage | We're independent, they sold to Coca-Cola |
| Store brands | Price play | We're worth the premium — check the ingredients |

## Brand Voice (Summary)

- **Real** — Say what's true. No marketing speak.
- **Warm** — Approachable, not pretentious. Friendly, not try-hard.
- **Confident** — We know our product is better. We don't need to shout about it.
- **Ingredient-proud** — Our ingredients ARE our marketing.

## Current Strategic Priority

Compete for attention against Liquid Death without copying their edge. Sharpen the authenticity angle — make "real ingredients" the most compelling story in sparkling water.

## Content Guidelines

- Always substantiate claims with real ingredients/facts
- Never disparage competitors directly
- Show, don't tell — let the ingredient list speak
- Use humor that comes from confidence, not edge
- Every piece of content should make someone want to read a Spindrift label
