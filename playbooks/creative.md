# Creative Division Playbook

**Division:** Creative
**Brand:** Spindrift — Sparkling Water Made with Real Squeezed Fruit
**Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## Core Responsibility

The Creative Division is the brand's voice, visual identity, and emotional engine. We translate Spindrift's strategic positioning — real squeezed fruit, nothing to hide — into ideas, concepts, and frameworks that make people feel something and then act.

We are the guardians of brand consistency and the instigators of brand distinctiveness. In a category where Liquid Death wins on attitude, LaCroix wins on ubiquity, and Topo Chico wins on heritage, Spindrift wins on authenticity. Every creative output must reinforce that truth.

## What We Own

- **Brand voice and tone:** The codified rules for how Spindrift speaks across every touchpoint — warm, honest, slightly playful, never corporate, never trying too hard. We are the opposite of Liquid Death's shock value; our edge is radical transparency.
- **Campaign concepts:** The big ideas behind seasonal pushes, flavor launches, cultural moments, and brand campaigns. From concept through approved direction.
- **Visual identity and direction:** Photography style (bright, natural light, real fruit front and center), illustration guidelines, typography hierarchy, color palette stewardship, packaging design direction.
- **Copy frameworks:** Headline structures, tagline development, key message hierarchies for campaigns. The words before they become a blog post or social caption.
- **Creative briefs (downstream):** Translating Strategy's strategic brief into a creative brief that Content and external agencies/freelancers can execute against.
- **Concept testing:** Partnering with Analytics to validate creative directions before full production investment.
- **Brand guidelines maintenance:** The living document that governs how Spindrift shows up everywhere.

## What We Hand Off

| Deliverable | Receiving Division | Handoff Format |
|---|---|---|
| Creative brief | Content | Written brief with concept, tone, visual direction, copy framework, asset specs, and dos/don'ts |
| Campaign concept deck | Growth | Presentation with concept narrative, key visuals (mood boards or rough comps), message hierarchy, audience-channel mapping |
| Copy frameworks | Content | Document with headline options, body copy direction, CTA language, tone calibration notes |
| Visual direction packages | Content | Mood boards, shot lists, style references, approved color/type specs for the specific campaign |
| Brand guidelines updates | All divisions | Updated brand guidelines PDF/Figma, distributed with change log |

**We do NOT own:** Final asset production (photography, video editing, social asset creation), editorial calendars, media placement, distribution schedules, or performance reporting. We set the creative direction; Content and Growth bring it to life in-market.

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate to Creative Director or VP of Marketing when:

1. **Brand voice violation:** An in-market asset is discovered that contradicts Spindrift's brand voice — e.g., using aggressive/confrontational tone (Liquid Death territory), making unsubstantiated health claims, or using "natural flavors" language that could confuse our real-fruit positioning.
2. **Visual identity breach:** Assets in-market or in-production that deviate from approved visual guidelines — wrong photography style (overly processed/artificial-looking imagery), unapproved color palette usage, or packaging elements used out of context.
3. **Concept testing failure:** A tested concept scores below the 40th percentile on relevance or below the 50th percentile on brand fit in quantitative concept testing. Do not proceed to production — escalate for strategic reassessment.
4. **Competitive creative collision:** A competitor launches a campaign that is creatively similar to work Spindrift has in development or in-market. Assess originality risk and potential for consumer confusion.
5. **Stakeholder creative override:** A non-Creative stakeholder (Sales, Retail, Executive) requests creative changes that compromise brand consistency. Creative has veto authority on brand-damaging requests; escalate to resolve disagreements.
6. **Scope expansion:** A project initially scoped as Tier 2 or Tier 3 (limited channels) is expanded to Tier 1 (full cross-channel) without corresponding timeline and resource adjustment.

## Quality Standards for Outputs

### Campaign Concepts
- Every concept must be rooted in a strategic brief from the Strategy Division. No brief, no concept work.
- Must pass the "Only Spindrift" test: could a competitor run this concept by swapping out the logo? If yes, the concept is not distinctive enough. Rework.
- Must feature or reference real fruit and/or real ingredients in at least the primary visual or headline. The can alone is not sufficient — the ingredient story must be visible.
- Must include at least 3 distinct executional routes for stakeholder review. Never present a single option.
- Must identify the primary emotion the concept targets: delight, trust, curiosity, craving, or belonging. "Refreshment" alone is insufficient — that is table stakes in sparkling water.

### Creative Briefs (to Content)
- Must include: campaign concept summary, target audience (from Strategy's segment cards), tone calibration (on the Spindrift tone spectrum: playful <-> sincere, casual <-> informed), visual direction with references, copy framework with sample headlines, mandatory inclusions (legal, disclaimers, hashtags), and asset specifications per channel.
- Must specify what is non-negotiable vs. flexible. Content needs room to execute, but guardrails must be clear.
- Turnaround: 3 business days from approved concept to completed creative brief.

### Visual Direction Packages
- Must include 5-10 reference images that represent the target aesthetic.
- Must specify lighting (natural/studio), composition (product-forward/lifestyle/ingredient-hero), color temperature, and retouching guidelines (minimal — we show real fruit, real imperfections).
- Photography direction must prioritize: real fruit in real states (sliced, squeezed, floating, splashing), the distinctive cloudy liquid in the glass/can, and human moments that feel unstaged.
- Explicitly exclude: overly polished/artificial food styling, neon or synthetic color treatments, any visual language that reads "enhanced" or "artificial."

### Copy Frameworks
- Headlines must be 8 words or fewer. Exception: long-form editorial headlines for content marketing.
- Must provide at least 5 headline options per campaign concept.
- Body copy direction must include a sample paragraph at the target tone and reading level (aim for 6th-8th grade reading level for consumer-facing copy).
- CTAs must be specific and action-oriented. "Learn More" is banned. Use: "See the real fruit," "Taste the difference," "Find Spindrift near you."
- All copy must be truthful and verifiable. "Made with real squeezed fruit" is a fact. "The healthiest sparkling water" is a claim we cannot substantiate. Know the difference.

## Key Workflows

### 1. Campaign Ideation

**Cadence:** Per strategic brief (typically 6-10 campaigns/year)
**Purpose:** Generate campaign concepts that are strategically sound, creatively distinctive, and uniquely Spindrift.

**Process:**
1. **Brief intake (Day 1):** Receive strategic brief from Strategy Division. Creative Director assigns a lead creative team (copywriter + art director/designer minimum). Clarify any ambiguities in the brief within 24 hours.
2. **Immersion (Days 1-2):** Creative team reviews the brief, relevant competitive work, previous Spindrift campaigns in the same space, and any available consumer research. Visit a store and look at the shelf. Buy competitor products. Taste them alongside Spindrift. This is not optional — sensory experience informs creative instinct.
3. **Ideation sprint (Days 3-5):** Generate a minimum of 15 raw concepts. Use a mix of methods: individual brainstorming, paired sessions, and at least one session that includes a non-Creative team member (fresh perspective). Concepts must span a range from safe-but-strong to ambitious-and-risky.
4. **Internal curation (Day 6):** Creative team narrows to 5-7 concepts. Apply the "Only Spindrift" test, the emotion test, and a feasibility gut-check (can Content actually produce this within budget and timeline?).
5. **Creative Director review (Day 7):** Present to Creative Director. Narrow to 3-4 concepts for stakeholder presentation.
6. **Concept development (Days 8-10):** Develop the selected concepts into presentation-ready decks: concept name, one-line description, key visual (mood board or rough comp), sample headline, channel expression examples (what this looks like on social, in retail, on DTC).
7. **Stakeholder presentation (Day 11-12):** Present to Strategy lead and Marketing leadership. Select winning concept and 1 backup. Document feedback and required modifications.
8. **Creative brief development (Days 12-15):** Translate winning concept into a creative brief for Content Division. (See Creative Brief Development workflow below.)

**Output:** Campaign concept deck (3-4 options), selected concept, creative brief.

### 2. Brand Refresh

**Cadence:** Annual (minor), every 2-3 years (major)
**Purpose:** Evolve Spindrift's visual and verbal identity to stay current without losing accumulated brand equity.

**Process:**
1. **Brand health audit (Weeks 1-2):** Partner with Analytics to review brand tracker data, social sentiment, and qualitative consumer feedback. Partner with Strategy to review competitive visual/verbal landscape. Identify what is working (keep), what is tired (evolve), and what is missing (add).
2. **Trend and culture scan (Week 2):** Review design trends, typography movements, photography styles, and cultural aesthetics relevant to Spindrift's audience. Important: Spindrift should be trend-aware but not trend-chasing. Real fruit does not need to be trendy — it needs to feel timeless and trustworthy.
3. **Evolution brief (Week 3):** Write an internal brief defining the refresh scope, rationale, and guardrails. Specify what is off-limits for change (e.g., the Spindrift wordmark, the real-fruit photography commitment, the core color palette).
4. **Exploration phase (Weeks 4-6):** Develop 3 refresh directions ranging from subtle evolution to notable shift. Each direction includes: updated color palette, typography refinements, photography style evolution, packaging mock-ups, social template mock-ups, and sample copy in updated voice.
5. **Internal testing (Week 7):** Share directions with a cross-divisional panel (minimum 8 people). Collect structured feedback using a standardized rubric: distinctiveness, brand fit, modernity, warmth, and shelf impact.
6. **Consumer testing (Weeks 8-9):** Partner with Analytics to test top 2 directions with target consumers. Test for: recognition, preference, attribute association (does it still say "real fruit"?), and competitive differentiation.
7. **Finalization (Weeks 10-12):** Refine selected direction based on testing. Update all brand guidelines. Produce a transition plan with Content and Growth for in-market asset updates.
8. **Rollout (Weeks 12-16):** Phase the refresh across touchpoints: DTC first (fastest to update), social second, retail POS third, packaging last (longest lead times).

**Output:** Updated brand guidelines, transition plan, rollout schedule.

### 3. Creative Brief Development

**Cadence:** Per campaign (follows campaign ideation)
**Purpose:** Translate approved campaign concepts into actionable briefs that Content Division can execute without ambiguity.

**Process:**
1. **Concept lock confirmation:** Verify that the campaign concept has received final approval from Creative Director and Strategy lead. No brief writing against unapproved concepts.
2. **Channel mapping:** Work with Growth to determine which channels are in scope. Each channel may need different tonal or format adaptations (a TikTok execution has different constraints than a Whole Foods endcap).
3. **Brief writing:** Populate the creative brief template:
   - **Project name and campaign concept summary**
   - **Target audience:** Pull directly from Strategy's segment cards. Add creative-specific nuance (what does this person's Instagram feed look like? What brands do they admire?).
   - **Key message:** Single sentence. What is the one thing we want the audience to take away?
   - **Supporting messages:** 2-3 proof points or secondary messages.
   - **Tone calibration:** Place the campaign on the Spindrift tone spectrum. Include 2-3 "sounds like" examples and 2-3 "does NOT sound like" examples.
   - **Visual direction:** Reference the visual direction package. Specify mandatory visual elements (e.g., "real fruit must appear in hero imagery") and restrictions.
   - **Copy framework:** Include sample headlines, body copy direction, CTA options.
   - **Mandatory inclusions:** Legal requirements, trademark usage, hashtag mandates, URL/QR requirements.
   - **Asset specifications:** Sizes, formats, file types, and quantities per channel.
   - **Timeline and milestones:** Draft review date, revision window, final delivery date.
   - **Non-negotiables vs. flex zones:** Clearly mark which elements Content must preserve exactly and where they have creative latitude.
4. **Content Division intake meeting:** Walk through the brief with the Content lead. Answer questions. Align on timeline. This is a conversation, not a document drop.
5. **Brief sign-off:** Creative Director and Content lead both sign off on the brief before production begins.

**Output:** Completed creative brief, supporting visual direction package, copy framework document.

### 4. Concept Testing

**Cadence:** For all Tier 1 campaigns and any Tier 2 campaign with budget exceeding $50K.
**Purpose:** Validate creative concepts with target consumers before committing production resources.

**Process:**
1. **Test design (with Analytics):** Define what we are testing — concept appeal, message clarity, brand fit, purchase intent, competitive differentiation. Analytics designs the methodology; Creative provides the stimuli.
2. **Stimuli preparation:** Develop test-ready materials for each concept (typically 2-3 concepts per test). Materials should be polished enough to evaluate but not so finished that sunk-cost bias influences decisions. Mood boards with sample headlines, not finished ads.
3. **Fielding:** Analytics manages fielding. Creative reviews respondent profiles to ensure the sample matches the target audience. Typical sample: n=200-400 per concept, recruited from Spindrift's target demographic.
4. **Results review:** Analytics presents topline results. Creative interprets through a creative lens:
   - Does the winning concept win for the right reasons (brand fit, real-fruit association) or the wrong reasons (generic refreshment appeal)?
   - Are there elements from losing concepts that could strengthen the winner?
   - Do any results surprise us in a way that challenges our assumptions?
5. **Go/No-Go/Iterate decision:**
   - **Go:** Concept scores above 60th percentile on brand fit AND above 50th percentile on appeal. Proceed to creative brief.
   - **Iterate:** Concept scores between 40th-60th on brand fit or between 35th-50th on appeal. Revise and retest key elements (not full concepts).
   - **No-Go:** Concept scores below 40th on brand fit or below 35th on appeal. Return to ideation. Escalate to Creative Director.
6. **Learning documentation:** Regardless of outcome, document what we learned about what resonates with Spindrift's audience. Add to the creative insights library.

**Output:** Concept test results summary, go/no-go recommendation, creative insights for future work.

## Brand Voice Quick Reference

### Spindrift Sounds Like:
- "We squeeze real fruit into every can. You can literally see it."
- "Honestly, some flavors sell out fast. Raspberry Lime, we're looking at you."
- "We started because we thought sparkling water could be better. Turns out, real fruit was the answer all along."

### Spindrift Does NOT Sound Like:
- "MURDER YOUR THIRST" (that is Liquid Death's territory and antithetical to our brand)
- "Enjoy the essence of natural flavors" (vague, evasive — this is what we differentiate against)
- "Premium artisanal sparkling water crafted for the discerning palate" (pretentious, inaccessible)
- "The healthy choice for your active lifestyle!" (generic wellness language with no specificity)

### Tone Spectrum (adjust per channel and campaign):
- **Social:** More playful, casual, conversational. Can be self-deprecating. Emoji use is moderate.
- **Retail/Packaging:** Confident, clean, ingredient-forward. Let the product speak.
- **DTC/Email:** Warm, personal, insider-ish. Like a friend who works at a brand they genuinely love.
- **PR/Earned:** Informed, transparent, values-driven. Founder story and ingredient sourcing as anchors.

## Appendix: Creative Evaluation Rubric

Score each concept 1-5 on the following criteria:

| Criteria | 1 (Weak) | 5 (Strong) |
|---|---|---|
| **Only Spindrift** | Any sparkling water brand could run this | Only Spindrift could credibly run this |
| **Real Fruit Forward** | Ingredients are invisible in the concept | Real fruit is central to the idea |
| **Emotional Resonance** | Functional/rational appeal only | Creates a genuine emotional response |
| **Distinctiveness** | Blends into category conventions | Stands out from Liquid Death/LaCroix/Topo Chico |
| **Executional Feasibility** | Requires resources/time we don't have | Achievable within typical campaign parameters |
| **Scalability** | Works in one channel/format only | Adapts across social, retail, DTC, OOH |

Minimum score to proceed: 20/30 overall, no single criterion below 3.
