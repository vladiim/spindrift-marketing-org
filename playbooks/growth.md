# Growth Division Playbook

**Division:** Growth
**Brand:** Spindrift — Sparkling Water Made with Real Squeezed Fruit
**Last Updated:** January 2026

## Core Responsibility

The Growth Division is Spindrift's acquisition and conversion engine. We determine how to reach new customers, bring them into the Spindrift ecosystem, convert interest into purchase, and build repeatable growth loops that compound over time.

In a category with $6B+ in annual U.S. sales and intensifying competition, growth is not about "more spend." It is about finding and exploiting the channels, loops, and conversion levers where Spindrift's real-fruit story creates disproportionate advantage. We do not win by outspending Liquid Death's influencer machine or LaCroix's grocery shelf dominance — we win by converting trial into loyalty faster because our product actually tastes different.

## What We Own

- **Acquisition channel strategy:** Selection, prioritization, and optimization of paid and organic channels — paid social (Meta, TikTok, YouTube), paid search, retail media networks (Instacart, Kroger, Amazon), influencer partnerships, sampling programs, and emerging channels.
- **Conversion optimization:** Spindrift.com and Amazon storefront conversion rate optimization, landing page strategy, checkout flow improvements, subscription funnel design.
- **Growth loops:** Design and operation of self-reinforcing growth mechanisms — referral programs, subscription models, sampling-to-purchase funnels, retail-to-DTC bridges.
- **Channel budgets and allocation:** How paid media budget is distributed across channels, with continuous reallocation based on performance.
- **A/B testing (channel and funnel level):** Testing of audiences, placements, landing pages, offers, and funnel configurations. (Creative-level A/B testing is co-owned with Creative; experiment design methodology is co-owned with Analytics.)
- **Partnership and co-marketing execution:** Operational execution of brand partnerships (e.g., Spindrift x SoulCycle, Spindrift x Sweetgreen), influencer campaigns, and retail co-op programs.
- **Retail media and shopper marketing:** Digital and in-store activation at the point of purchase — Instacart ads, retailer loyalty programs, endcap negotiations, sampling events.

## What We Hand Off

| Deliverable | Receiving Division | Handoff Format |
|---|---|---|
| Creative asset requests | Creative | Briefing document specifying channel, format, audience, CTA, and performance benchmarks from prior assets |
| Content distribution requirements | Content | Channel specs, posting cadences, SEO keyword targets from paid search data |
| Performance data for strategic interpretation | Strategy | Monthly performance summary with channel-level metrics and trend flags |
| Experiment results for analysis | Analytics | Raw test data, test configuration details, initial observations |
| Measurement requirements | Analytics | Attribution requirements, tracking specs, tagging needs for new campaigns |

**We do NOT own:** Brand voice or creative direction (Creative), content production (Content), strategic positioning (Strategy), or measurement methodology (Analytics). We are voracious consumers of great creative and rigorous data, but we do not produce either.

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate to Growth Lead or VP of Marketing when:

1. **CAC exceeds threshold:** Customer acquisition cost on any channel exceeds 2x the trailing 90-day average for more than 2 consecutive weeks without an identified cause. At Spindrift's price point (~$6-8 per 8-pack), DTC CAC must stay below $18 for first purchase; subscription CAC can tolerate up to $25 given higher LTV.
2. **Channel collapse:** Any channel contributing more than 15% of acquisition volume shows a >30% decline in efficiency (cost per acquisition or ROAS) within a 2-week period. This can indicate platform algorithm changes (Meta is notorious), creative fatigue, or competitive saturation.
3. **Conversion rate drop:** Spindrift.com or Amazon conversion rate drops more than 20% week-over-week without a known cause (e.g., seasonal dip, site maintenance).
4. **Budget overrun or underrun exceeding 15%:** Pacing significantly ahead or behind plan requires reallocation decisions that affect other divisions.
5. **Competitive channel aggression:** A competitor (particularly Liquid Death, which is heavily funded) enters a channel where Spindrift has been dominant with spend levels that materially increase auction costs. Example: Liquid Death doubling Instacart ad spend in a key metro.
6. **Partnership risk:** An active or imminent brand partnership surfaces reputational or brand-alignment concerns (e.g., a partner brand faces a PR crisis, or partnership execution quality falls below Spindrift's standards).
7. **Growth loop stall:** A growth loop that has been scaling (e.g., referral program) shows 3 consecutive weeks of declining loop velocity without an identified cause.

## Quality Standards for Outputs

### Channel Evaluations
- Must include: total addressable reach, estimated CPA range, audience overlap with Spindrift's target segments, competitive presence/intensity, creative format requirements, minimum viable test budget, and expected timeline to read results.
- Must benchmark against Spindrift's top 3 performing channels on a cost-per-trial and cost-per-repeat-purchase basis.
- Any new channel recommendation must include a kill criteria — the specific performance threshold below which we exit the channel and the timeline for evaluation (typically 6-8 weeks).

### A/B Test Plans
- Must include: hypothesis (written as "We believe [change] will [impact metric] because [rationale]"), test configuration (control, variant(s), audience, channel, duration, sample size), primary and secondary metrics, minimum detectable effect, and statistical significance threshold (default: 95% confidence, 80% power).
- Must be reviewed by Analytics Division before launch to validate methodology and sample sizing.
- Results must be documented in the experiment log within 5 business days of test conclusion, including: outcome, confidence level, business impact estimate, and recommended action.

### Growth Loop Designs
- Must map the complete loop with clear entry points, value exchanges, and re-entry mechanisms.
- Must quantify the loop multiplier (how many new users does each existing user generate?) and the loop cycle time (how long does one complete loop take?).
- Must identify the loop's primary bottleneck and the plan to widen it.
- Must include a financial model showing unit economics at current scale and at 3x scale.

### Monthly Channel Performance Reports
- Must cover: spend, impressions, clicks, CPA, ROAS, new customer acquisition, repeat customer rate, and channel-specific KPIs (e.g., subscription conversion rate for DTC, market basket size for retail media).
- Must include month-over-month and year-over-year comparisons.
- Must flag any metric that has moved more than 15% in either direction with a root cause hypothesis.
- Must include a "next month actions" section with specific optimization plans.

## Key Workflows

### 1. Channel Evaluation

**Cadence:** Quarterly review of channel portfolio + ad-hoc evaluation of emerging channels
**Purpose:** Ensure Spindrift's channel mix is optimized and evolving with consumer behavior and competitive dynamics.

**Process:**
1. **Portfolio review (Quarterly, Week 1):**
   - Pull trailing-quarter performance for all active channels.
   - Rank channels by: CPA, ROAS, volume contribution, growth trajectory, and strategic alignment (does this channel reach an audience we are under-indexed with?).
   - Identify channels in each quadrant: Scale (high efficiency + high volume), Optimize (high efficiency + low volume), Watch (low efficiency + high volume), and Consider Exiting (low efficiency + low volume).
2. **Competitive channel audit (Week 1-2):**
   - Using Pathmatics, SimilarWeb, and social listening tools, map where Liquid Death, LaCroix, and Topo Chico are investing.
   - Identify channels where Spindrift has whitespace (competitors are absent or under-invested) — these are high-priority for evaluation.
   - Identify channels where competition is intensifying — model whether increased competition has structurally raised costs or if it is temporary.
3. **Emerging channel assessment (Week 2):**
   - Evaluate 1-2 emerging channels per quarter (e.g., Reddit Ads, connected TV, podcast networks, retail media expansion to new retailers, BeReal, Threads).
   - Apply the channel evaluation quality standards above.
   - Prioritize channels that align with Spindrift's authenticity positioning — channels where "real" content outperforms polished content are natural fits.
4. **Reallocation recommendation (Week 3):**
   - Propose budget reallocation across channels for the next quarter.
   - Rule of thumb: 70% to proven channels, 20% to scaling channels, 10% to experimental channels.
   - All reallocation proposals must include an impact model: "Moving $X from Channel A to Channel B is expected to yield Y additional customers at Z CPA."
5. **Stakeholder alignment (Week 3-4):**
   - Present to Strategy (for strategic alignment) and Analytics (for measurement feasibility).
   - Finalize and distribute the updated channel plan.

**Output:** Quarterly Channel Portfolio Report, reallocation proposal, emerging channel evaluations.

### 2. A/B Testing Program

**Cadence:** Continuous — minimum 4 tests running at any time across channels and funnel
**Purpose:** Generate compounding improvements through disciplined experimentation.

**Process:**
1. **Test backlog management:**
   - Maintain a prioritized backlog of test hypotheses organized by: channel tests (audience, placement, bid strategy), creative tests (co-owned with Creative), funnel tests (landing page, checkout, offer), and loop tests (referral mechanics, subscription flow).
   - Prioritize using ICE framework: Impact (potential upside) x Confidence (evidence supporting hypothesis) x Ease (speed and cost to test). Score each 1-10, multiply.
2. **Test design:**
   - Write the hypothesis per quality standards.
   - Determine sample size requirements with Analytics (use Spindrift's historical conversion rates as baseline — typically 2-4% for DTC cold traffic, 8-12% for retargeting, 15-25% for email).
   - Set test duration. Minimum 7 days for paid media tests (to capture day-of-week variation). Minimum 14 days for funnel tests.
3. **Test execution:**
   - Launch test with clean audience isolation. No audience overlap between test and control.
   - Monitor daily for data quality issues (tracking breaks, audience contamination, budget pacing errors). Do NOT make optimization decisions based on partial data.
   - If a variant is significantly underperforming and the test will negatively impact business results above the approved risk threshold ($5K in wasted spend or 500 lost conversions), pause the variant and document the early termination.
4. **Results analysis:**
   - Wait for statistical significance before calling results. Gut reactions are not results.
   - Analyze primary metric first, then secondary metrics. A winning variant on CPA that tanks brand sentiment is not a winner.
   - Document results in the experiment log.
5. **Implementation:**
   - Winners become the new baseline within 5 business days.
   - Share learnings at the bi-weekly cross-divisional sync. Patterns across tests (e.g., "real fruit close-up imagery consistently outperforms lifestyle imagery on Meta") become inputs for Creative's ongoing work.

**Output:** Updated experiment log, winning variants implemented, cross-divisional learning briefs.

### 3. Growth Loop Design

**Cadence:** 1-2 new loop designs per year, continuous optimization of active loops
**Purpose:** Build self-reinforcing acquisition mechanisms that reduce dependency on paid media.

**Active and Target Growth Loops for Spindrift:**

**Loop 1: Sampling-to-Subscription**
- Entry: Consumer tries Spindrift through a sampling event (retail, event, office), receives a card/QR with DTC trial offer.
- Action: Consumer visits Spindrift.com, redeems offer (e.g., first 8-pack for $4.99 shipped).
- Value exchange: Consumer discovers real-fruit difference at low risk. Spindrift captures email + purchase data.
- Re-entry: Post-purchase email sequence drives subscription signup. Subscriber becomes sampling advocate through referral program.
- Key metrics: Sample-to-trial conversion (target: 8-12%), trial-to-subscription conversion (target: 15-20%), referral rate (target: 10-15% of subscribers refer at least one friend).

**Loop 2: Referral Flywheel**
- Entry: Existing subscriber shares a personal referral link.
- Action: Referred friend gets a trial offer (e.g., $5 off first order). Referrer gets a credit ($5 off next shipment).
- Value exchange: New customer gets a low-risk trial. Existing customer gets tangible value for advocacy.
- Re-entry: New customer becomes referrer themselves.
- Key metrics: Referral rate, referred customer LTV vs. paid acquisition LTV (target: referred customers should have 20%+ higher LTV), loop cycle time (target: under 30 days).

**Loop 3: Retail-to-DTC Bridge**
- Entry: Consumer buys Spindrift at grocery store. On-pack QR code drives to a content experience (fruit sourcing story, flavor quiz, recipe).
- Action: Consumer engages with content, opts into email list.
- Value exchange: Consumer gets an interesting content experience + exclusive DTC offer. Spindrift captures a retail customer into an owned channel.
- Re-entry: Email nurture drives DTC purchase, subscription trial, and eventually referral.
- Key metrics: QR scan rate (target: 0.5-1% of units sold), email capture rate (target: 30% of scanners), DTC conversion from retail bridge (target: 10% within 90 days).

**Loop Design Process:**
1. Map the loop visually with all entry points, actions, value exchanges, and re-entry points.
2. Quantify each step's conversion rate using existing data or benchmarks.
3. Calculate the loop multiplier and cycle time.
4. Identify the bottleneck (lowest conversion step) and design 3 interventions to improve it.
5. Build a financial model showing unit economics and scale projections.
6. Present to Strategy and Analytics for alignment and measurement planning.
7. Launch as a minimum viable loop — test the core mechanic before investing in full build-out.
8. Optimize continuously based on Analytics' weekly loop performance reports.

**Output:** Growth loop design document, financial model, measurement plan, MVP scope.

### 4. Conversion Funnel Optimization

**Cadence:** Continuous — review monthly, optimize weekly
**Purpose:** Maximize the percentage of interested consumers who complete a purchase.

**Spindrift's Key Funnels:**

**DTC Funnel (Spindrift.com):**
- Awareness (paid/organic traffic) -> Landing page -> Product page -> Cart -> Checkout -> Purchase -> Subscription upsell
- Current benchmarks: Landing page -> Product page: 40-50%, Product page -> Cart: 12-18%, Cart -> Purchase: 55-65%, Purchase -> Subscription: 8-12%
- Optimization priority areas:
  - Landing pages: Test hero imagery (product vs. fruit vs. lifestyle), headline (ingredient story vs. taste promise vs. social proof), and primary CTA.
  - Product pages: Test social proof placement (reviews, UGC), flavor recommendation engine, bundle offers.
  - Cart: Test free shipping thresholds, subscription savings display, urgency elements (if authentic — no fake countdown timers, this is not our brand).
  - Post-purchase: Test subscription upsell timing, offer structure, and messaging.

**Amazon Funnel:**
- Search/Browse -> Product listing -> Purchase -> Subscribe & Save
- Optimization levers: A+ content, main image optimization, title/bullet optimization, review solicitation, Subscribe & Save discount optimization.
- Competitive focus: Ensure Spindrift appears for branded searches and key category searches ("sparkling water with real fruit," "natural sparkling water," "sparkling water no artificial flavors").

**Retail Trial Funnel:**
- Shelf visibility -> Pick up -> Purchase -> Repeat purchase
- Growth Division's role: Work with Sales on shelf placement strategy, endcap/display execution, and in-store sampling ROI analysis. Coordinate with retail media (Instacart, Kroger Precision Marketing) for digital-to-shelf activation.

**Monthly Optimization Process:**
1. Pull funnel metrics for all active funnels.
2. Identify the largest absolute drop-off point (where are we losing the most potential customers?).
3. Hypothesize causes: Is it a traffic quality issue? A messaging mismatch? A UX friction point? A pricing concern?
4. Design and prioritize tests to address the top 2-3 drop-off points.
5. Execute tests per the A/B Testing Program workflow.
6. Implement winners and move to the next set of drop-off points.

**Output:** Monthly funnel performance report, test priorities, optimization log.

## Channel-Specific Notes for Spindrift

### Meta (Instagram/Facebook)
- Top performer for DTC acquisition. Real-fruit imagery and UGC-style creative outperform polished brand ads by 30-40% on CPA.
- Key audiences: health-conscious parents 28-45, fitness/wellness 25-38, sober-curious 21-35.
- Watch for creative fatigue — refresh top-of-funnel creative every 3-4 weeks.

### TikTok
- High potential for awareness and trial among Gen-Z/young millennial audience.
- Authentic, lo-fi content dramatically outperforms brand-produced content. Partner with micro-influencers (10K-100K followers) who genuinely use the product.
- The "real fruit you can see in the can" is a natural TikTok moment — visual, surprising, shareable.

### Instacart / Retail Media
- Critical for capturing in-market grocery shoppers. Bid on category terms ("sparkling water"), competitor conquesting terms ("LaCroix," "Topo Chico"), and brand defense terms ("Spindrift").
- Coordinate with Sales team on promotional calendars — align digital retail media with in-store promotions for compounding effect.

### Podcast
- Strong channel for storytelling and brand building. Target health, wellness, food/cooking, and parenting podcasts.
- Host-read ads significantly outperform pre-produced spots. Send hosts actual product and let them react genuinely — Spindrift's taste difference is the best ad.

### Sampling
- Most expensive per-touch but highest conversion to repeat purchase among all channels.
- Prioritize locations where target consumers are already in a health-conscious mindset: gyms, yoga studios, farmers markets, Whole Foods/Sprouts.
- Always pair sampling with a digital capture mechanism (QR code, text-to-subscribe).
