# Content Division Playbook

**Division:** Content
**Brand:** Spindrift — Sparkling Water Made with Real Squeezed Fruit
**Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## Core Responsibility

The Content Division is Spindrift's production engine and editorial voice. We take the strategic direction from Strategy and the creative frameworks from Creative, and we turn them into the actual assets, posts, articles, videos, emails, and experiences that consumers see, read, watch, and share.

We are the division closest to the daily output that represents Spindrift in the world. That means we carry an outsized responsibility for consistency, quality, and volume. We must be prolific without being sloppy, efficient without being formulaic, and on-brand without being boring.

In a sparkling water category where consumers encounter dozens of brand messages daily, our content must earn attention through genuine substance — the real-fruit story gives us something most competitors lack: actual things worth saying.

## What We Own

- **Editorial calendar:** The master schedule of what gets published, where, and when across all content channels — social media, blog, email, YouTube, podcast (if applicable), and retail content (shelf talkers, in-store signage).
- **Content production:** Writing, design, photography direction, video production, and audio production for all planned content. This includes managing freelancers, agencies, and production partners.
- **Social media management:** Day-to-day posting, community management, and real-time content across Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X/Twitter, Pinterest, and LinkedIn.
- **Email marketing production:** Newsletter design and copywriting, automated flow creation (welcome series, post-purchase, re-engagement, subscription management), and email template maintenance.
- **SEO content strategy and execution:** Keyword research, on-page optimization, content creation for organic search visibility, and technical SEO coordination with web development.
- **Content distribution:** Getting produced content into the right channels at the right times, including organic social posting, email sends, blog publishing, and syndication to retail partners.
- **Content repurposing:** Systematically extending the life and reach of content by adapting it across formats and channels.
- **User-generated content (UGC) program:** Soliciting, curating, and deploying consumer-created content that showcases real people enjoying Spindrift.

## What We Hand Off

| Deliverable | Receiving Division | Handoff Format |
|---|---|---|
| Content performance data | Analytics | Raw engagement and traffic metrics via shared dashboards; flagged anomalies for investigation |

We receive strategic and creative direction; we produce and distribute.

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate to Content Lead or VP of Marketing when:

1. **Brand crisis content need:** A situation requiring real-time brand response — product recall, social media controversy, negative press, or viral misinformation about Spindrift's ingredients. Content should NOT publish crisis-related content without approval from VP of Marketing and Legal.
2. **Creative brief gap:** A campaign is scheduled to launch within 10 business days and no creative brief has been received from Creative Division. This means either the brief is late (escalate to Creative Director) or the campaign timeline is unrealistic (escalate to project stakeholders).
3. **Production capacity overflow:** The content backlog exceeds what the team can produce at quality standards within the committed timeline. Specifically: if the team is carrying more than 15 assets past their scheduled delivery date, escalate for resource reinforcement or scope reduction.
4. **Negative engagement spike:** A piece of content receives negative engagement (comments, quote-tweets, media coverage) that exceeds 3x the typical negative response rate, indicating a potential brand issue beyond normal noise.
5. **Legal/compliance concern:** Content involves ingredient claims, health claims, competitive comparisons, or consumer testimonials that may require legal review. When in doubt, escalate. Spindrift's "real squeezed fruit" claim is factual and defensible, but adjacent claims ("healthier than," "better for you") require scrutiny.
6. **SEO ranking loss:** Spindrift loses first-page ranking for any of the top 10 priority keywords (e.g., "sparkling water with real fruit," "best sparkling water," "Spindrift flavors") for more than 2 consecutive weeks.
7. **Platform policy change:** A social media platform changes its algorithm, content policies, or features in a way that materially impacts Spindrift's content strategy (e.g., Instagram deprioritizing link posts, TikTok banning food/beverage claims).

## Quality Standards for Outputs

### Social Media Posts
- Must align with the active creative brief and current brand voice guidelines. Every post should be traceable to a strategic or editorial objective — no posting for the sake of posting.
- Visual assets must meet minimum resolution requirements: 1080x1080 (feed), 1080x1920 (stories/reels), 1920x1080 (YouTube thumbnails).
- Copy must be proofread by a second team member before scheduling. Zero tolerance for typos, incorrect product names, or factual errors about ingredients.
- Hashtag strategy: use 3-5 targeted hashtags per post (not 30). Include #Spindrift and #RealSqueezerFruit on every post. Rotate secondary hashtags based on content theme.
- Response time for community management: acknowledge comments/DMs within 4 hours during business hours, within 12 hours outside business hours. Negative comments about product quality get priority response.
- UGC reposts must have explicit permission documented before publishing. A comment saying "love this!" on the original post is NOT permission.

### Blog / Long-Form Content
- Minimum 800 words for SEO-targeted articles. Optimal range: 1,200-2,000 words.
- Must include at least one original image or custom graphic (no generic stock photos of "someone drinking water").
- Must be optimized for the target keyword: keyword in title, H1, first 100 words, meta description, and at least 2 subheadings. But readability comes first — never sacrifice natural language for keyword stuffing.
- Must include internal links to at least 2 other Spindrift pages (product pages, other blog posts, the "Our Story" page).
- Factual claims about ingredients, sourcing, or nutrition must be verified against approved product documentation. If a claim cannot be verified, remove it.
- Reading level: 6th-8th grade for consumer-facing content. Use Hemingway Editor or equivalent to validate.

### Email Marketing
- Subject lines: 6-10 words, tested with at least 2 variants per send (A/B test on open rate).
- Preview text must complement (not repeat) the subject line.
- Email body: single primary CTA per email. Secondary CTAs are permitted but must be visually subordinate.
- Mobile-first design: all emails must render correctly on mobile (60%+ of Spindrift's email opens are mobile).
- Unsubscribe process must be frictionless — one click. Never hide the unsubscribe link or add guilt-trip language.
- Automated flows (welcome series, post-purchase, re-engagement) must be audited quarterly for accuracy, relevance, and performance. Stale flows are worse than no flows.
- Personalization: use first name in subject line or greeting when available. Use purchase history for product recommendations when available. Never personalize incorrectly — "Hi [FIRST_NAME]" is a fireable offense.

### Video Content
- First 3 seconds must hook — show the fruit, show the pour, show the reaction. The real-fruit visual is our most powerful video asset.
- Branded content must display the Spindrift logo or product within the first 5 seconds for paid placements, within the first 10 seconds for organic.
- Captions/subtitles required on all video content (85% of social video is watched without sound).
- Vertical (9:16) versions required for all social video content. Horizontal (16:9) versions required for YouTube and website.
- Raw/authentic video (iPhone quality) is acceptable and often preferred for TikTok and Instagram Reels. Polished production is expected for YouTube, website hero videos, and retail partner content.

### SEO Content
- All new pages and posts must have: unique title tag (under 60 characters), meta description (under 155 characters), proper heading hierarchy (one H1, structured H2/H3), alt text on all images, and schema markup where applicable.
- Target one primary keyword and 2-3 secondary keywords per page.
- New content must target keywords with a minimum monthly search volume of 200 (for long-tail) or align with a strategic content pillar regardless of volume.
- Content must provide genuine value beyond what the top 5 current SERP results offer. If we cannot add something new — a Spindrift-specific perspective, original data, or a unique angle tied to real ingredients — the content does not warrant production.

## Key Workflows

### 1. Content Calendar Planning

**Cadence:** Monthly (full calendar), weekly (adjustments)
**Purpose:** Ensure a steady, strategic cadence of content across all channels with no gaps, redundancies, or off-brand posts.

**Process:**
1. **Input gathering (Month prior, Week 3):**
   - Collect upcoming campaign briefs from Creative (what campaigns are launching and need content support?).
   - Collect seasonal and cultural calendar dates (holidays, awareness months, food/beverage events, relevant cultural moments).
   - Review Growth Division's channel priorities (which channels need more content investment?).
   - Pull Spindrift product calendar from Product/Innovation team (new flavors, limited editions, packaging changes).
   - Review SEO keyword opportunities from the latest keyword research.
   - Check inventory of evergreen content that can be repurposed or refreshed.
2. **Calendar drafting (Month prior, Week 4):**
   - Map content across channels by week, specifying: content type (feed post, story, reel, blog, email, video), topic/theme, target audience segment, strategic objective (awareness, engagement, traffic, conversion), and owner (team member or freelancer).
   - Balance content mix: aim for 40% brand storytelling (real-fruit sourcing, founder story, behind-the-scenes), 25% product-focused (flavor highlights, recipes, use occasions), 20% community/UGC (customer stories, reposts), 15% cultural/seasonal (relevant moments tied back to Spindrift).
   - Ensure minimum posting cadences are met: Instagram 5x/week, TikTok 4x/week, Facebook 3x/week, Email 2x/month (newsletter) + automated flows, Blog 2x/month.
3. **Calendar review (Month prior, final week):**
   - Creative Director reviews for brand consistency and creative alignment.
   - Growth lead reviews for channel strategy alignment.
   - Content lead approves final calendar.
4. **Weekly calibration:**
   - Every Monday, review the upcoming week's content. Adjust for: real-time opportunities (trending moments, viral UGC), underperformance of a content theme that warrants pausing, and capacity issues.
   - Leave 10-15% of calendar capacity unscheduled to accommodate reactive content opportunities.

**Output:** Monthly content calendar (shared via project management tool), weekly adjustment log.

### 2. Content Production Pipeline

**Cadence:** Continuous — governed by the editorial calendar
**Purpose:** Move content from concept to published asset with consistent quality and predictable timelines.

**Pipeline Stages:**

| Stage | Owner | Duration | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Brief/Assignment | Content Lead | Day 1 | Content assignment with brief, references, specs, deadline |
| 2. First Draft | Writer/Designer/Producer | 2-3 days | Draft copy, draft visual, rough cut video |
| 3. Internal Review | Peer reviewer | 1 day | Feedback on accuracy, tone, brand alignment, technical quality |
| 4. Revision | Original creator | 1 day | Revised asset incorporating feedback |
| 5. Final Approval | Content Lead | Same day | Approved for publishing or escalated for additional review |
| 6. Scheduling/Publishing | Social/Email manager | Same day | Queued in scheduling tool or published live |
| 7. Post-publish monitoring | Community manager | 24-48 hours | Engagement tracking, comment response, issue flagging |

**Standard lead times:**
- Social media post (static): 5 business days from assignment to publish-ready
- Social media post (video/reel): 7 business days
- Blog post: 10 business days
- Email newsletter: 7 business days
- Email automation flow (new): 15 business days
- Video (produced): 15-20 business days

**Capacity management:**
- Each content creator should carry no more than 8 active assignments at any stage of the pipeline.
- If backlog exceeds 15 overdue items, trigger the capacity escalation (see Escalation Triggers).
- Freelancer/agency activation threshold: when internal team is at 90%+ capacity for 2 consecutive weeks.

### 3. Distribution Playbook

**Cadence:** Aligned with content calendar; reviewed quarterly
**Purpose:** Ensure every piece of content reaches its intended audience through the optimal channels at the optimal times.

**Channel-Specific Distribution Guidelines:**

**Instagram:**
- Feed posts: Schedule for 11am-1pm or 7pm-9pm ET (highest engagement windows per Spindrift's historical data). Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday outperform other days.
- Stories: Post 3-5 per day during active campaigns. Use polls, quizzes, and question stickers for engagement. Always include a swipe-up/link sticker for product pages.
- Reels: Publish within TikTok-first content workflow (create for TikTok, adapt for Reels). Post at peak discovery hours (9am-11am ET).

**TikTok:**
- Post at 7am, 12pm, or 7pm ET. Test and adjust based on follower activity data.
- Prioritize trending sounds and formats but only when they can be authentically connected to Spindrift's real-fruit story. Forced trend-jacking is worse than skipping a trend.
- First comment strategy: post a pinned first comment that adds context, asks a question, or includes a CTA.

**Email:**
- Newsletter sends: Tuesday or Thursday, 10am ET. Avoid Monday (inbox overload) and Friday (weekend check-out).
- Automated flows: Welcome series triggers immediately on signup. Post-purchase triggers 2 hours after order confirmation. Re-engagement triggers after 60 days of inactivity.
- Segment sends by purchase history and engagement level. Never send the same email to the entire list.

**Blog/SEO:**
- Publish new posts Tuesday-Thursday for optimal indexing.
- Promote each new blog post across social (3 posts over 2 weeks), in the next newsletter, and through internal linking from 2+ existing pages.
- Update and republish high-performing evergreen posts every 6 months with fresh data, images, and optimization.

**Cross-posting protocol:**
- Every piece of hero content (campaign-level or high-investment) should be adapted for at least 3 channels.
- Adaptation means format-native execution, not copy-paste. A blog post summary is not a social media post. A TikTok is not a YouTube video.

### 4. Content Repurposing

**Cadence:** Ongoing — systematized into the production pipeline
**Purpose:** Extract maximum value from every piece of content investment by adapting it across formats, channels, and timeframes.

**Repurposing Framework:**

Every Tier 1 content asset (campaign hero content, long-form video, major blog post) should generate a minimum of 8 derivative assets:

| Source Asset | Derivative Assets |
|---|---|
| Long-form video (2-5 min) | 3-5 short clips (15-60 sec) for Reels/TikTok, 1 GIF, pull quotes as static graphics, full transcript as blog post, audio clip for podcast/stories |
| Blog post (1,500+ words) | 3-5 social media posts (key takeaways as individual posts), 1 infographic, 1 email newsletter feature, 1 Pinterest pin, SEO-optimized snippet for Google featured snippet |
| Photo shoot | Hero images for web, cropped versions for social (square, vertical, horizontal), detail shots for product pages, behind-the-scenes content for stories, edited versions for email headers |
| Customer testimonial | Quote graphic for social, video testimonial clip, case study for blog, review excerpt for product page, email social proof element |

**Repurposing process:**
1. **Tagging at creation:** When a Tier 1 asset enters production, the Content Lead identifies the planned derivatives and adds them to the editorial calendar with deadlines.
2. **Derivative production:** Assign derivatives to team members. Derivatives should be produced within 2 weeks of the source asset's publication.
3. **Staggered distribution:** Do not publish all derivatives at once. Stagger over 2-4 weeks to extend the content's lifespan and reach.
4. **Evergreen recycling:** High-performing content (top 20% by engagement or traffic) enters the evergreen rotation queue. Repost/reshare every 60-90 days with updated copy but original visuals (unless visuals are dated).
5. **Performance comparison:** Track whether derivatives outperform or underperform the source asset. This reveals which formats and channels Spindrift's audience prefers and informs future content investment.

**Output:** Repurposing tracker (linked to editorial calendar), derivative asset library.

## Content Pillar Framework for Spindrift

### Pillar 1: Real Ingredients, Real Story (40% of content)
The cornerstone of Spindrift's content. Sourcing stories (where do the lemons come from?), production transparency (how is the fruit squeezed?), ingredient comparisons (our label vs. theirs), founder Bill Creelman's story, and the mission behind real ingredients.

**Why it works:** No competitor can match this pillar because no competitor uses real squeezed fruit. This is Spindrift's unfair content advantage.

### Pillar 2: Flavor and Occasion (25% of content)
Product-forward content that drives trial and discovery. Flavor spotlights, seasonal flavors, recipe integrations (Spindrift as a cocktail/mocktail mixer), food pairings, and occasion-based content (morning, workout, happy hour, kids' lunch).

**Why it works:** Spindrift has a genuine flavor story that goes beyond "hint of lime." Real fruit creates real taste complexity worth exploring.

### Pillar 3: Community and Culture (20% of content)
UGC, customer stories, team spotlights, community events, and cultural moments that connect Spindrift to the lives of its consumers. Sober-curious content, wellness content, parenting content — wherever Spindrift naturally fits.

**Why it works:** Builds emotional connection beyond product attributes. Liquid Death does this through irreverence; Spindrift does it through warmth and authenticity.

### Pillar 4: Category and Education (15% of content)
Informational content that helps consumers understand sparkling water — reading labels, understanding "natural flavors" vs. real fruit, hydration science, sustainability in beverage packaging. Positioned as educational, not preachy.

**Why it works:** Educated consumers are Spindrift's best customers. When people learn what "natural flavors" actually means, they often switch to Spindrift. This pillar drives that education.
