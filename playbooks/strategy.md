# Strategy Division Playbook

**Division:** Strategy
**Brand:** Spindrift — Sparkling Water Made with Real Squeezed Fruit
**Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## Core Responsibility

The Strategy Division is the navigational engine of Spindrift's marketing organization. We define *where to play* and *how to win* across all marketing efforts. Every campaign, channel decision, and pricing move should trace back to a strategic brief or framework originated here.

Our mandate: ensure Spindrift's positioning as the only sparkling water made with real squeezed fruit translates into defensible market share growth against Liquid Death, LaCroix, Topo Chico, and private-label entrants.

## What We Own

- **Brand positioning and platform:** The articulation of Spindrift's unique value proposition — real fruit, real ingredients, nothing artificial — and how it maps against the competitive set.
- **Competitive intelligence:** Ongoing monitoring of Liquid Death (lifestyle/irreverence positioning), LaCroix (flavor variety/mass appeal), Topo Chico (premium/mixology angle), AHA, Waterloo, and emerging DTC entrants.
- **Go-to-market planning:** Strategic frameworks for new flavor launches, seasonal pushes, retail expansion, and partnership initiatives.
- **Pricing strategy recommendations:** Analysis of price-per-unit positioning across channels (grocery, convenience, club, DTC) relative to competitors.
- **Audience segmentation:** Definition and refinement of target segments — health-conscious millennials/Gen-Z, parents seeking clean-label beverages, sober-curious consumers, fitness communities.
- **Strategic briefs:** The foundational documents that inform all downstream creative, content, growth, and analytics work.
- **Annual and quarterly marketing plans:** Top-level objectives, key results, budget allocation frameworks, and strategic priorities.

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate to VP of Marketing or CMO when:

1. **Competitive disruption:** A direct competitor (Liquid Death, LaCroix, Topo Chico) launches a product that directly mimics Spindrift's real-fruit positioning or makes comparable ingredient claims.
2. **Positioning drift:** Internal review reveals that active campaigns across divisions have deviated from the approved positioning platform — e.g., leading with "sparkling water" generics rather than the "real squeezed fruit" differentiator.
3. **Price war signals:** Competitor pricing drops more than 15% in a key channel (tracked via Nielsen/IRI), or a retailer requests promotional pricing that would compress margins below threshold.
4. **Segment conflict:** Two or more divisions are targeting the same audience segment with conflicting messages or value propositions in the same time window.
5. **Category shift:** Macro trend data (from Mintel, IBISWorld, or internal analytics) indicates a structural change in the sparkling water category — e.g., functional ingredients overtaking clean-label as the primary purchase driver.
6. **Budget reallocation above 20%:** Any proposed shift of more than 20% of quarterly budget between strategic priorities requires escalation.

## Quality Standards for Outputs

### Strategic Briefs
- Must include: business objective, target audience (with segment card reference), positioning statement, competitive context, key message hierarchy, success metrics, timeline, and budget envelope.
- Positioning statement must reference Spindrift's real-fruit differentiator. If the brief does not hinge on this differentiator, a written rationale for the exception is required.
- Must be reviewed by at least one other strategist before distribution.
- Turnaround: 5 business days for standard briefs, 2 business days for reactive/opportunistic briefs.

### Competitive Intelligence Reports
- Monthly reports must cover: new product launches, pricing changes, distribution shifts, advertising spend estimates (via Pathmatics/MediaRadar), social sentiment shifts, and notable earned media.
- Each competitor entry must include a "So What for Spindrift" interpretation — raw data without strategic implication is incomplete.
- Sources must be cited. No single-source conclusions.

### Go-to-Market Plans
- Must map to one of the approved annual strategic priorities.
- Must include a channel-level rollout sequence (not just "launch everywhere").
- Must specify the handoff points to Growth, Creative, and Content with dates.
- Must include a risk register with at least 3 identified risks and mitigations.

### Pricing Recommendations
- Must include competitive price benchmarking across at least 3 channels.
- Must model margin impact at 3 price points (floor, recommended, aspirational).
- Must reference historical elasticity data where available.

## Key Workflows

### 1. Quarterly Positioning Review

**Cadence:** First two weeks of each quarter
**Purpose:** Validate that Spindrift's positioning remains differentiated, relevant, and consistently executed.

**Process:**
1. **Audit inputs (Days 1-3):** Collect all active campaign assets, landing pages, packaging copy, social bios, and retail POS materials. Pull brand tracker data (aided/unaided awareness, attribute associations, NPS).
2. **Competitive mapping (Days 3-5):** Update the positioning map plotting Spindrift vs. Liquid Death (edgy/lifestyle), LaCroix (mass/accessible), Topo Chico (premium/heritage), and others on axes of ingredient authenticity vs. brand personality intensity.
3. **Gap analysis (Days 5-7):** Identify where Spindrift's real-fruit positioning is being under-leveraged or where competitors are encroaching. Flag any campaigns that have drifted toward generic "refreshment" messaging.
4. **Recommendation memo (Days 7-10):** Produce a 2-3 page memo with: positioning health score (1-10), key gaps, recommended adjustments, and specific guidance for Creative and Content divisions for the upcoming quarter.
5. **Stakeholder review (Days 10-14):** Present to division leads. Finalize and distribute updated positioning guardrails.

**Output:** Quarterly Positioning Health Report and updated guardrails document.

### 2. Competitive Landscape Update

**Cadence:** Monthly (full report), weekly (scan), ad-hoc (alerts)
**Purpose:** Ensure Spindrift never gets surprised by a competitor move.

**Process:**
1. **Weekly scan:** 30-minute review of competitor social channels, Google Alerts, trade press (BevNET, Food Dive), and retailer flyers. Log notable items in the competitive tracker spreadsheet.
2. **Monthly deep-dive:**
   - Pull advertising spend estimates for Liquid Death, LaCroix, Topo Chico, and top 3 emerging brands.
   - Review new SKU launches, packaging changes, and distribution gains/losses.
   - Analyze social sentiment trends using Brandwatch/Sprout data.
   - Interview 2-3 internal stakeholders (sales, retail, DTC) for field intelligence.
3. **Alert protocol:** If a competitor makes a move that directly threatens Spindrift's positioning (e.g., LaCroix launches a "real juice" line), issue a same-day competitive alert to all division leads with initial assessment and recommended response options.

**Output:** Monthly Competitive Brief (distributed to all divisions), weekly scan log, ad-hoc alerts.

### 3. Go-to-Market Planning

**Cadence:** Per initiative (typically 4-6 per year for new flavors, seasonal campaigns, retail launches)
**Purpose:** Create a unified, cross-divisional plan that moves from strategy to market execution.

**Process:**
1. **Initiative scoping (Week 1):** Define the business objective, target audience, positioning angle, and success metrics. Determine whether this is a Tier 1 (full cross-channel), Tier 2 (select channels), or Tier 3 (single channel) launch.
2. **Strategic brief development (Week 2):** Write the strategic brief per quality standards above. For new flavor launches, include flavor story (origin of the fruit, sourcing narrative), target occasion (morning, afternoon, evening, active), and competitive whitespace analysis.
3. **Cross-divisional kickoff (Week 3):** Present brief to Creative, Content, Growth, and Analytics leads. Gather feasibility input. Assign division-level owners and timelines.
4. **GTM document finalization (Week 4):** Consolidate division inputs into a single GTM plan with: channel rollout sequence, asset requirements, budget allocation, timeline with milestones, and measurement plan.
5. **Execution monitoring:** Strategy attends weekly GTM standups but does not manage execution. We flag strategic misalignment; execution issues are owned by the respective division.

**Output:** GTM Plan document, strategic brief, cross-divisional kickoff deck.

### 4. Pricing Analysis

**Cadence:** Semi-annual (comprehensive), ad-hoc (reactive)
**Purpose:** Ensure Spindrift's pricing reflects its premium positioning without creating barriers to trial.

**Process:**
1. **Data collection:** Pull current retail pricing across grocery (Whole Foods, Kroger, Target), convenience, club (Costco), and DTC (Spindrift.com, Amazon). Collect competitor pricing for equivalent pack sizes.
2. **Elasticity review:** Analyze historical promotional data — how do volume and revenue respond to price changes? Where are the inflection points?
3. **Channel-specific analysis:** Spindrift's pricing strategy differs by channel. Whole Foods shoppers tolerate a higher premium than Walmart shoppers. Model the optimal price point per channel using margin targets, competitive parity, and consumer willingness-to-pay data.
4. **Recommendation development:** Produce a pricing memo with recommended price points per channel per SKU, supported by data. Include a "real fruit premium" calculation — the quantified value consumers assign to real ingredients vs. natural flavors (LaCroix) or mineral water (Topo Chico).
5. **Stakeholder alignment:** Present to Finance, Sales, and Marketing leadership. Strategy recommends; Finance and Sales approve.

**Output:** Pricing Analysis Memo, channel-level price matrix, promotional pricing guardrails.
