# Spindrift Ideal Customer Profile

## Primary Persona: "The Label Reader"

### Demographics
- **Age:** 27-42 (core), with a growing 22-26 tail
- **Income:** $55K-$130K household; enough to pay a premium without agonizing, not so wealthy that price is invisible
- **Geography:** Urban and inner-ring suburban. Over-indexes in Northeast, Pacific Northwest, and Colorado/mountain West. Growing in Austin, Nashville, Raleigh-Durham, and similar "second city" metros
- **Education:** College-educated; disproportionately holds a bachelor's or higher
- **Household:** Mix of DINK couples, young families (1-2 kids under 8), and singles living with roommates or alone
- **Gender:** Skews ~58% female for purchase decision, but consumption is near-even

### Psychographics
- **Identity anchor:** "I care about what I put in my body, but I'm not weird about it." They see themselves as informed, not obsessive. They'll eat a pizza on Friday and a grain bowl on Monday and feel fine about both.
- **Relationship with health:** Health is a baseline, not a personality. They don't post gym selfies. They do quietly read nutrition panels in the aisle.
- **Authenticity radar:** Highly tuned. They can smell performative "clean" branding from a shelf away. They distrust "natural flavors" as a phrase. They want to understand what's actually in the can.
- **Status signaling:** Subtle. They don't need a skull on their can to feel cool. Having Spindrift in the fridge signals taste and intentionality, not rebellion. It's the sparkling water equivalent of wearing Patagonia instead of a Supreme hoodie.
- **Environmental consciousness:** Present but pragmatic. They recycle, they notice packaging claims, but they're not single-issue voters on sustainability. They appreciate effort without requiring perfection.
- **Relationship with brands:** Loyal once earned, but the loyalty is to the product truth, not the logo. If Spindrift changed its formula, they'd leave. They stay because the product keeps its promise.

### Behavioral Profile
- **Shopping cadence:** Weekly grocery runs (Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Target, local co-ops) plus periodic Costco/Amazon bulk orders
- **Discovery channels:** In-store trial (seeing it on shelf, sampling), friend/partner recommendation, Instagram (organic, not ads), podcast mentions they trust, TikTok recipe/lifestyle content
- **Purchase pattern:** Starts with a single 8-pack flavor trial. Graduates to multi-flavor rotation. Power users buy 3-4 flavors and keep a stocked fridge. Bulk purchase (Costco 24-pack) is the loyalty milestone.
- **Consumption occasions:**
  - Workday desk hydration (replacing a second coffee or afternoon soda)
  - Evening wind-down (replacing a beer or glass of wine, especially Sun-Thu)
  - Weekend social hosting (offering guests something better than tap water)
  - Kids' beverages (parents trust the ingredient list enough to give it to children)
  - Mixer for cocktails and mocktails
- **Adjacent purchases:** Organic produce, specialty coffee, premium yogurt (Siggi's, etc.), quality snacks (Lesser Evil, Siete), sparkling water machines (they may own a SodaStream AND buy Spindrift)
- **Digital behavior:** 2-4 hours daily on phone. Instagram and TikTok for discovery, Reddit for research, podcasts during commute/chores. Low Facebook usage. They skip YouTube pre-rolls but watch creator integrations.

### Media Habits
- **Podcasts:** NPR shows, health/wellness (Huberman adjacent but not bro-science), comedy (Smartless, Conan), culture (The Daily, Ezra Klein), niche hobby pods
- **Social:** Instagram (curated feed, stories > reels), TikTok (consumer but selective poster), LinkedIn (professional but not hustle-culture), minimal Twitter/X
- **Streaming:** Netflix, HBO, Hulu. Ad-supported tiers are common (they tolerate ads for savings). They notice product placement.
- **Print/digital reading:** Bon Appetit, NYT Cooking, The Cut, Wirecutter for purchase decisions, Strategist for recs
- **Influencer trust:** Micro > macro. They trust a nutritionist with 30K followers over a celebrity with 3M. Authenticity of recommendation matters more than reach.

### Purchase Triggers
1. **Ingredient comparison moment:** They pick up a LaCroix, read "natural flavors," put it back, pick up Spindrift, read "real squeezed fruit," and buy it. This single moment converts more customers than any ad.
2. **Life-stage health shift:** Cutting back on alcohol, getting pregnant, post-diagnosis dietary change, or just turning 30 and deciding to drink less soda.
3. **Social proof (analog):** Seeing it in a friend's fridge, being handed one at a party, noticing it at a meeting. Physical trial in trusted contexts.
4. **Taste surprise:** Expecting "another flavored seltzer" and tasting actual fruit. The slight cloudiness, the real lemon pulp, the difference is immediate and converts on first sip.
5. **Bulk availability:** Seeing it at Costco or on Amazon Subscribe & Save removes the "this is too expensive for everyday" objection.

### Objections (and How to Overcome)
| Objection | Reality | Response Strategy |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| "It's expensive vs. LaCroix/store brand" | ~$1.00-$1.25/can vs. $0.40-$0.60 | Reframe: it's cheaper than juice, kombucha, or a coffee. You're replacing those, not replacing water. |
| "I can't taste the difference" | Rare once they try it, but exists pre-trial | Sampling is the answer. Every trial program should lead with side-by-side comparison. |
| "It has calories/sugar" | 5-15 cal per can, all from real fruit | Lean in: "Yes, because there's real fruit in here. Zero-calorie means zero fruit." This is a feature. |
| "I already drink plain sparkling water" | They're not anti-flavor, they're anti-fake | Position as an upgrade for moments when plain water isn't enough, not a replacement for all hydration. |
| "I don't know the brand" | Awareness gap, especially outside Northeast | Invest in trial, sampling, in-store visibility. Awareness converts to purchase at a high rate. |

### Jobs to Be Done Framework

**Core JTBD:**
> "When I want something to drink that feels like a treat but doesn't compromise my standards, I want a beverage that tastes genuinely good with ingredients I actually trust, so I can enjoy it without the guilt math."

**Functional Jobs:**
- Hydrate in a way that's more interesting than plain water
- Replace a less-healthy habit (soda, juice, afternoon coffee, weeknight wine) without feeling deprived
- Serve guests something that feels thoughtful and elevated
- Give my kids a flavored drink I don't have to second-guess

**Emotional Jobs:**
- Feel like I'm making a smart choice without performing "wellness"
- Enjoy a small daily luxury that doesn't require justification
- Feel confident when someone sees what I'm drinking (no embarrassment, mild pride)
- Avoid the cognitive dissonance of "natural flavors" on a can that claims to be pure

**Social Jobs:**
- Signal that I pay attention to quality without being pretentious
- Have something to offer at gatherings that starts a positive conversation
- Participate in the "what are you drinking" social moment with something genuine
- Model good beverage choices for my kids/partner/friends without lecturing

### Anti-Persona: Who Is NOT Our Customer
- **The price optimizer:** Buys whatever 12-pack is on sale. Sees all sparkling water as identical. Will never pay a premium.
- **The edge-seeker:** Buys Liquid Death for the skull, the brand, the attitude. Spindrift's sincerity reads as boring to them. Let them go.
- **The zero-everything purist:** Won't drink anything with calories, sugar, or carbs regardless of source. The 10 calories from real lemon juice is a dealbreaker. Not our fight.
- **The tap water loyalist:** Believes all bottled/canned beverages are wasteful. Principled position we shouldn't argue with.
