# Spindrift Brand Voice Guide

## Voice Philosophy

Spindrift's voice is the verbal equivalent of the product: real, uncomplicated, and better than it has to be. We talk like a smart friend who works in food and genuinely loves what they do -- not a brand that hired an agency to sound human. We're confident because we have something real to be confident about. We don't need to be loud, edgy, or performative. The product does the heavy lifting. The voice just has to get out of the way and let the truth land.

## Core Voice Attributes

### 1. Real (not raw)
We say what's true without over-polishing it. But we're not performatively unfiltered. We're honest, not chaotic.

- **Do:** "There's real lemon juice in here. That's why it's a little cloudy."
- **Don't:** "Our artisanally crafted lemon essence delivers a premium hydration experience."
- **Don't:** "It's literally just fruit in water, bro."

### 2. Warm (not soft)
We're approachable and friendly, but we have a backbone. Think warm handshake, not group hug.

|----------|--|
| Cold/clinical | --- | --- | --- | **[Spindrift]** | --- | Saccharine/try-hard friendly |

- **Do:** "Glad you're here. Grab a Raspberry."
- **Don't:** "Spindrift welcomes you to explore our portfolio of offerings."
- **Don't:** "OMG you guys we're SO happy you found us!!!"

### 3. Confident (not cocky)
We know our product is different and better in a specific, provable way. We state it plainly. We don't need to shout, brag, or put others down.

| Timid/hedging | --- | --- | --- | **[Spindrift]** | --- | Arrogant/combative |

- **Do:** "We use real squeezed fruit. Check the ingredients."

- **Don't:** "Do you even know what 'natural flavors' means? You should be scared."

### 5. Fun (not trying too hard)
We have a sense of humor. It's dry, observational, and grounded. We don't force jokes or chase trends.

| Spectrum | |

## Tone Variations by Context

The voice stays consistent. The tone adjusts.

### Social Media (Instagram, TikTok)
**Tone:** Casual, witty, conversational. Slightly more playful. Speak like a person, not a brand account.
- Shorter sentences. Fragments are fine.
- Humor lands through understatement, not spectacle.
- Engage with followers like peers, not fans.
- Show the product in real life, not on pedestals.

### Email Marketing
**Tone:** Warm, direct, respectful of inbox space. Get to the point, but make the point interesting.
- Subject lines: clear benefit or curiosity, never clickbait.
- Body: conversational but purposeful. Every paragraph earns its place.
- CTAs: plain language. "Try it" over "Shop Now." "See what's new" over "Explore Our Collection."

### Packaging & In-Store
**Tone:** Clean, confident, minimal. Let the ingredient list speak. Supporting copy is brief and factual.
- The can itself is the loudest marketing asset. Keep copy tight.
- Ingredient callouts should feel proud, not defensive.
- Shelf presence should feel calm and premium in a sea of visual noise.

### Advertising (Paid Social, Display, Video)
**Tone:** Slightly more assertive. This is where we make our claim and back it up.
- Lead with the product truth, then the feeling.
- Comparison is fine through implication. Never name competitors in ads.
- End on the ingredient list or the product. Not a lifestyle vignette.

### PR & Press
**Tone:** Professional, informed, warm. The voice of a company that knows its industry and respects journalists' time.
- Data and sourcing facts are welcome here.
- Founder voice can be more personal and story-driven.
- Industry context (why "natural flavors" exist, how the category works) adds credibility.

### Customer Service
**Tone:** Genuine, helpful, human. Fix the problem, keep the friend.
- Apologize when warranted, simply and once.
- Don't over-script. Reps should sound like themselves, within brand guardrails.
- If someone found pulp or cloudiness surprising, explain with pride: "That's the real fruit."

### Corporate / Investor
**Tone:** Confident, precise, forward-looking. The voice grows up but doesn't lose its warmth.
- Lead with market position and product differentiation.
- Use data, not adjectives.
- Maintain the ingredient-truth narrative as a strategic moat, not just a marketing angle.

## Vocabulary Preferences

### Words We Use
| Word | Why |
|------|-----|
| Real | Our entire brand truth in one word |
| Squeezed | Active, tangible, implies a human process |
| Fruit (specific names) | "Real lemon" beats "real fruit" -- specificity builds trust |
| Made with | Simple, factual, unpretentious |
| Ingredients | We like this word. We have nothing to hide. |
| Sparkling water | What we are. No need to overcomplicate. |
| Tastes like | Invites sensory connection |
| Simple | Aligns with our ingredient philosophy |
| Refreshing | Earned, when used sparingly |
| Cloudy | Embraced as proof, not apologized for |

### Words We Avoid
| Word | Why |
|------|-----|
| Natural flavors | That's what the other guys use. We say what ours actually are. |
| Clean | Overused, vague, implies others are "dirty" -- too preachy |
| Healthy | We don't make health claims. We make ingredient claims. Let customers draw conclusions. |
| Guilt-free | Implies guilt exists. We don't traffic in food shame. |
| Artisanal / Craft / Small-batch | We're a national brand. Don't pretend otherwise. Be honestly scaled. |
| Disrupting / Revolutionary | We're not disrupting water. We're making it with real fruit. Calm down. |
| Superfood / Functional | We're not a supplement. We're a sparkling water with fruit in it. |
| Beverage experience | No. |
| Hydration journey | Absolutely not. |
| Wellness | Too loaded. We're a drink, not a lifestyle prescription. |
| Hack / Life hack | Dated, reductive, not our energy. |
| Obsessed | "We're obsessed with quality." No. We just do it. |

### Punctuation & Style Notes
- **Sentence case** for headlines, not Title Case (unless required by platform).
- **Periods in headlines** are fine. They add quiet confidence.
- **Exclamation marks:** Max one per piece of content. Earn it.
- **Ellipses:** Sparingly. For genuine trailing thought, not manufactured suspense.
- **Emoji:** Light touch. Fruit emoji are on-brand. Skull emoji are not. Limit to 1-2 per social post max. None in email body copy, packaging, or ads.
- **Hashtags:** Minimal. #Spindrift and campaign-specific tags only. No #CleanEating #HealthyLifestyle chains.
- **ALL CAPS:** Only for one word for emphasis, max. Never full sentences.

## Sample Copy by Format

### Social Media (Instagram)

**Product-focused post:**
> Real grapefruit juice. Sparkling water. That's the ingredient list. That's the whole post.

**Engagement post:**
> The slight cloudiness in the can? That's the fruit. You're welcome or sorry depending on how you feel about pulp.

**Seasonal/new flavor:**
> Pineapple season. Real pineapple in the can. Not pineapple "flavor" or pineapple "essence." Pineapple. The fruit that grows on a plant.

**Reply to a fan:**
> Fan: "Spindrift is the only sparkling water I trust"
> Spindrift: "Flip any of our cans over. That trust is earned."

### Email

**Subject line examples:**

## Voice Anti-Patterns (What We Are NOT)

### We are not Liquid Death.
They chose irony, aggression, and shock value. It works for them. But our product has a real story to tell, and we don't need a costume to tell it. When Liquid Death's novelty fades, our ingredient list will still be on the can.

### We are not a wellness brand.
We don't prescribe. We don't moralize about hydration. We don't count glasses of water per day. We made a good drink with real ingredients. That's it.

### We are not a luxury brand.
We're premium, not exclusive. Spindrift should feel like the best option at the grocery store, not something you need a membership to access.

### We are not a startup anymore.
We don't need to sound scrappy or insurgent. We're nationally distributed and growing. We can be confident without performing underdog energy.

### We are not trying to be funny on the internet.
If something is genuinely funny, great. But we don't manufacture virality. Our humor comes from honesty and observation, not from trend-jacking or shock. The goal is respect, not retweets.

## Decision Filter for Voice Questions

When in doubt about whether copy sounds like Spindrift, run it through these questions:

1. **Is this true?** If you can't back it up with the ingredient list or a fact, cut it.
2. **Would a real person say this?** If it sounds like a brand deck, rewrite it.
3. **Are we punching down?** We don't mock people's choices. We offer a better option and explain why.
4. **Would we be embarrassed by this in 5 years?** If it relies on a trend, meme, or moment, it'll age badly. Timeless beats timely.
5. **Does this need the exclamation mark?** Probably not. Remove it and see if the sentence is still energetic. If not, the problem is the sentence, not the punctuation.
